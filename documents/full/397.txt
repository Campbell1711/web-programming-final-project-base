that but i would have thee hence and here again exit boy i do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicate his behavior to love will after he hath laugh at such shallow folly in other become the argument of his own scorn by failing in love and such a man is claudio i have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabour and the pipe i have known when he would have walk ten mile a foot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turn orthography his words are a very fantastic banquet just so many strange dishes may i be so convert and see with these eyes i cannot tell i think not i will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but i ll take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool one woman is fair yet i am well another is wise yet i am well another virtuous yet i am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace rich she shall be that s certain wise or i ll none virtuous or i ll never cheapen her fair or i ll never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not i for an angel of good discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall be of what colour it

come hither leonato what was it you told me of to day that your niece beatrice was in love with signior benedick claudio o ay stalk on stalk on the fowl sit i did never think that lady would have love any man leonato no nor i neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on signior benedick whom she hath in all outward behavior seem ever to abhor benedick is t possible sit the wind in that corner leonato by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to think of it but that she love him with an enrage affection it is past the infinite of thought don pedro may be she doth but counterfeit claudio faith like enough leonato o god counterfeit there was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discover it don pedro why what effects of passion show she claudio bait the hook well this fish will bite leonato what effects my lord she will sit you you heard my daughter tell you how claudio she did indeed don pedro how how pray you you amaze me i would have i thought her spirit had been invincible against all assault of affection leonato i would have sworn it had my lord especially against benedick benedick i should think this a gull but that the white bearded fellow speak it knavery cannot sure hide himself in such reverence claudio he hath ta en the infection hold it up don pedro hath she made her affection known to benedick leonato no and swear she never will that s her torment claudio  tis true indeed so your daughter say shall i say she that have so oft encounter him with scorn write to him that i love him leonato this say she now when she is beginning to write to him for she ll be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tell us all claudio now you talk of a sheet of paper i remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of leonato o when she had writ it and was reading it over she found benedick and beatrice between the sheet claudio that leonato o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence rail at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her i measure him say she by my own spirit for i should flout him if he writ to me yea though i love him i should claudio then down upon her knee she falls weep sob beat her heart tear her hair pray curse o sweet benedick god give me patience leonato she doth indeed my daughter say so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeare she will do a desperate outrage to herself it is very true don pedro it were good that benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover it claudio to what end he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse don pedro an he should it were an alms to hang him she s an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous claudio and she is exceed wise don pedro in every thing but in loving benedick leonato o my lord wisdom and blood combat in so tender a body we have ten proof to one that blood hath the victory i am sorry for her as i have just cause being her uncle and her guardian don pedro i would she had bestow this dotage on me i would have daff all other respects and made her half myself i pray you tell benedick of it and hear what a will say leonato were it good think you claudio hero think surely she will die for she say she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed cross don pedro she doth well if she should make tender of her love tis very possible he ll scorn it for the man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit claudio he is a very proper man don pedro he hath indeed a good outward happiness claudio before god and in my mind very wise don pedro he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit claudio and i take him to be valiant don pedro as hector i assure you and in the manage of quarrel you may say he is wise for either he avoid them with great discretion or undertake them with a most christian like fear leonato if he do fear god a must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and tremble don pedro and so will he do for the man doth fear god howsoever it seem not in him by some large jest he will make well i am sorry for your niece shall we go seek benedick and tell him of her love claudio never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel leonato nay that s impossible she may wear her heart out first don pedro well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while i love benedick well and i could wish he would modest examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady leonato my lord will you walk dinner is ready claudio if he do not dote on her upon this i will never trust my expectation don pedro let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry the sport will be when they hold one an opinion of another s dotage and no such matter that s the scene that i would see which will be merely a dumb show let us send her to call him in to dinner exeunt don pedro claudio and leonato benedick coming forward  this can be no trick the conference was sadly borne they have the truth of this from hero they seem to pity the lady it seem her affection have their full bent love me why it must be requite i hear how i am censure they say i will bear myself proud if i perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection i did never think to marry i must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detract and can put them to mending they say the lady is fair tis a truth i can bear them witness and virtuous tis so i cannot reprove it and wise but for loving me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for i will be horrible in love with her i may chance have some odd quirk and remnant of wit broken on me because i have rail so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter a man love the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age shall quip and sentence and these paper bullet of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour no the world must be people when i said i would die a bachelor i did not think i should live till i were married here come beatrice by this day she s a fair lady i do spy some mark of love in her enter beatrice beatrice against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner benedick fair beatrice i thank you for your pains beatrice i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful i would not have come benedick you take pleasure then in the message beatrice yea just so much as you may take upon a knife s point and choke a daw withal you have no stomach signior fare you well exit benedick ha against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner there s a double meaning in that i took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me that s as much as to say any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks if i do not take pity of her i am a villain if i do not love her i am a jew i will go get her picture exit

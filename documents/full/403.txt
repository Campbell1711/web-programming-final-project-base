frugal nature s frame o one too much by thee why had i one why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes why had i not with charitable hand took up a beggar s issue at my gate who smirch d thus and mire with infamy i might have said no part of it is mine this shame derive itself from unknown loins but mine and mine i love and mine i praise and mine that i was proud on mine so much that i myself was to myself not mine value of her why she o she is fallen into a pit of ink that the wide sea hath drops too few to wash her clean again and salt too little which may season give to her foul taint flesh benedick sir sir be patient for my part i am so attire in wonder i know not what to say beatrice o on my soul my cousin is belie benedick lady were you her bedfellow last night beatrice no truly not although until last night i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow leonato confirm d confirm d o that is strong made which was before barr d up with rib of iron would the two prince lie and claudio lie who love her so that speak of her foul wash d it with tear hence from her let her die friar francis hear me a little for i have only been silent so long and given way unto this course of fortune by note of the lady i have mark d a thousand blush apparition to start into her face a thousand innocent shame in angel white beat away those blush and in her eye there hath appear d a fire to burn the error that these prince hold against her maiden truth call me a fool trust not my reading nor my observations which with experimental seal doth warrant the tenor of my book trust not my age my reverence calling nor divinity if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here under some biting error leonato friar it cannot be thou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she will not add to her damnation a sin of perjury she not deny it why seek st thou then to cover with excuse that which appear in proper naked friar francis lady what man is he you are accused of hero they know that do accuse me i know none if i know more of any man alive than that which maiden modesty doth warrant let all my sin lack mercy o my father prove you that any man with me converse at hour unmeet or that i yesternight maintain d the change of words with any creature refuse me hate me torture me to death friar francis there is some strange misprision in the prince benedick two of them have the very bent of honour and if their wisdom be misle in this the practise of it lives in john the bastard whose spirits toil in frame of villany leonato i know not if they speak but truth of her these hand shall tear her if they wrong her honour the proudest of them shall well hear of it time hath not yet so dry this blood of mine nor age so eat up my invention nor fortune made such havoc of my means nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall find awake in such a kind both strength of limb and policy of mind ability in means and choice of friends to quit me of them through friar francis pause awhile and let my counsel sway you in this case your daughter here the prince left for dead let her awhile be secret kept in and publish it that she is dead indeed maintain a mourning ostentation and on your family s old monument hang mournful epitaph and do all rite that appertain unto a burial leonato what shall become of this what will this do friar francis marry this well carry shall on her behalf change slander to remorse that is some good but not for that dream i on this strange course but on this travail look for greater birth she die as it must so be maintain d upon the instant that she was accused shall be lament pity and excuse of every hearer for it so falls out that what we have we prize not to the worth while we enjoy it but being lack d and lost why then we rack the value then we find the virtue that possession would not show us while it was ours so will it fare with claudio when he shall hear she die upon his words the idea of her life shall sweet creep into his study of imagination and every lovely organ of her life shall come apparell d in more precious habit more moving delicate and full of life into the eye and prospect of his soul than when she live indeed then shall he mourn if ever love had interest in his liver and wish he had not so accused her no though he thought his accusation true let this be so and doubt not but success will fashion the event in better shape than i can lay it down in likelihood but if all aim but this be levell d false the supposition of the lady s death will quench the wonder of her infamy and if it sort not well you may conceal her as best befit her wound reputation in some recluse and religious life out of all eyes tongue mind and injury benedick signior leonato let the friar advise you and though you know my inwardness and love is very much unto the prince and claudio yet by mine honour i will deal in this as secret and just as your soul should with your body leonato being that i flow in grief the smallest twine may lead me friar francis  tis well consent presently away for to strange sore strange they strain the cure come lady die to live this wedding day perhaps is but prolong d have patience

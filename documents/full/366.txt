for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general he would be crown d how that might change his nature there s the question it is the bright day that bring forth the adder and that crave wary walking crown him that and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with the abuse of great is when it disjoin remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar i have not known when his affection sway d more than his reason but tis a common proof that lowly is young ambition s ladder whereto the climber upward turn his face but when he once attain the upmost round he then unto the ladder turn his back looks in the cloud scorn the base degree by which he did ascend so caesar may then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel will bear no colour for the thing he is fashion it thus that what he is augment would run to these and these extremities and therefore think him as a serpent s egg which hatch d would as his kind grow mischievous and kill him in the shell re enter luciu luciu the taper burneth in your closet sir searching the window for a flint i found this paper thus seal d up and i am sure it did not lie there when i went to bed give him the letter brutu get you to bed again it is not day is not to morrow boy the ides of march luciu i know not sir brutu look in the calendar and bring me word luciu i will sir exit brutu the

brutu re enter luciu luciu sir march is waste fourteen days knock within brutu  tis good go to the gate somebody knock exit luciu since cassius first did whet me against caesar i have not slept between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream the genius and the mortal instrument are then in council and the state of man like to a little kingdom suffer then the nature of an insurrection re enter luciu luciu sir tis your brother cassius at the door who doth desire to see you brutu is he alone luciu no sir there are moe with him brutu do you know them luciu no sir their hat are pluck d about their ear and half their face bury in their cloak that by no means i may discover them by any mark of favour brutu let em enter exit luciu they are the faction o conspiracy shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night when evil are most free o then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy hide it in smile and affable for if thou path thy native semblance on not erebu itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention enter the conspirator cassius casca deciu brutu cinna metellu cimber and treboniu cassius i think we are too bold upon your rest good morrow brutu do we trouble you brutu i have been up this hour awake all night know i these men that come along with you cassius yes every man of them and no man here but honours you and every one doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself which every noble roman bear of you this is treboniu brutu he is welcome hither cassius this deciu brutu brutu he is welcome too cassius this casca this cinna and this metellu cimber brutu they are all welcome what watchful care do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night cassius shall i entreat a word brutu and cassius whisper deciu brutu here lie the east doth not the day break here casca no cinna o pardon sir it doth and yon gray lines that fret the cloud are messenger of day casca you shall confess that you are both deceive here as i point my sword the sun arise which is a great way grow on the south weigh the youthful season of the year some two month hence up higher toward the north he first presents his fire and the high east stand as the capitol directly here brutu give me your hand all over one by one cassius and let us swear our resolution brutu no not an oath if not the face of men the sufferance of our soul the time s abuse if these be motive weak break off betimes and every man hence to his idle bed so let high sighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery but if these as i am sure they do bear fire enough to kindle coward and to steel with valour the melting spirits of women then countrymen what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress what other bond than secret roman that have spoke the word and will not palter and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged that this shall be or we will fall for it swear priest and coward and men cautelous old feeble carrion and such suffering soul that welcome wrong unto bad cause swear such creature as men doubt but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath when every drop of blood that every roman bear and nobly bear is guilty of a several bastardy if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath pass d from him cassius but what of cicero shall we sound him i think he will stand very strong with us casca let us not leave him out cinna no by no means metellu cimber o let us have him for his silver hair will purchase us a good opinion and buy men s voice to commend our deed it shall be said his judgment rule our hand our youth and wild shall no whit appear but all be bury in his gravity brutu o name him not let us not break with him for he will never follow any thing that other men begin cassius then leave him out casca indeed he is not fit deciu brutu shall no man else be touch d but only caesar cassius deciu well urge i think it is not meet mark antony so well beloved of caesar should outlive caesar we shall find of him a shrewd contrive and you know his means if he improve them may well stretch so far as to annoy us all which to prevent let antony and caesar fall together brutu our course will seem too bloody caiu cassius to cut the head off and then hack the limb like wrath in death and envy afterwards for antony is but a limb of caesar let us be sacrifice but not butcher caiu we all stand up against the spirit of caesar and in the spirit of men there is no blood o that we then could come by caesar s spirit and not dismember caesar but alas caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends let s kill him bold but not wrathful let s carve him as a dish fit for the gods not hew him as a carcass fit for hound and let our heart as subtle master do stir up their servant to an act of rage and after seem to chide em this shall make our purpose necessary and not envious which so appear to the common eyes we shall be call d purge not murder and for mark antony think not of him for he can do no more than caesar s arm when caesar s head is off cassius yet i fear him for in the ingraft love he bear to caesar brutu alas good cassius do not think of him if he love caesar all that he can do is to himself take thought and die for caesar and that were much he should for he is given to sports to wild and much company treboniu there is no fear in him let him not die for he will live and laugh at this hereafter clock strike brutu peace count the clock cassius the clock hath stricken three treboniu  tis time to part cassius but it is doubtful yet whether caesar will come forth to day or no for he is superstitious grown of late quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy of dream and ceremony it may be these apparent prodigy the unaccustom d terror of this night and the persuasion of his augur may hold him from the capitol to day deciu brutu never fear that if he be so resolve i can o ersway him for he love to hear that unicorn may be betray d with tree and bear with glasses elephant with hole lion with toils and men with flatter but when i tell him he hate flatter he say he do being then most flatter let me work for i can give his humour the true bent and i will bring him to the capitol cassius nay we will all of us be there to fetch him brutu by the eighth hour is that the uttermost cinna be that the uttermost and fail not then metellu cimber caiu ligariu doth bear caesar hard who rate him for speak well of pompey i wonder none of you have thought of him brutu now good metellu go along by him he love me well and i have given him reason send him but hither and i ll fashion him cassius the morning come upon s we ll leave you brutu and friends disperse yourself but all remember what you have said and show yourself true roman brutu good gentlemen

beteem them from the tempest of my eyes lysander ay me for aught that i could ever read could ever hear by tale or history the course of true love never did run smooth but either it was different in blood hermia o cross too high to be enthrall d to low lysander or else misgraff in respect of years hermia o spite too old to be engaged to young lysander or else it stood upon the choice of friends hermia o hell to choose love by another s eyes lysander or if there were a sympathy in choice war death or sickness did lay siege to it making it momentany as a sound swift as a shadow short as any dream brief as the lightning in the collie night that in a spleen unfold both heaven and earth and ere a man hath power to say behold the jaws of dark do devour it up so quick bright things come to confusion hermia if then true lovers have been ever cross d it stand as an edict in destiny then let us teach our trial patience because it is a customary cross as due to love as thought and dream and sigh wish and tear poor fancy s follower lysander a good persuasion therefore hear me hermia i have a widow aunt a dowager of great revenue and she hath no child from athens is her house remote seven league and she respects me as her only son there gentle hermia may i marry thee and to that place the sharp athenian law cannot pursue us if thou lovest me then steal forth thy father s house to morrow night and in the wood a league without the town where i did meet thee once with helena to do observance to a morn of may there will i stay for thee hermia my good lysander i swear to thee by cupid s strongest bow by his best arrow with the golden head by the simplicity of venus dove by that which knitteth soul and prosper love and by that fire which burn d the carthage queen when the false troyan under sail was seen by all the vow that ever men have broke in number more than ever women spoke in that same place thou hast appoint me to morrow truly will i meet with thee lysander keep promise love look here come helena enter helena hermia god speed fair helena whither away helena call you me fair that fair again unsay demetriu love your fair o happy fair your eyes are lode stars and your tongue s sweet air more tune than lark to shepherd s ear when wheat is green when hawthorn bud appear sickness is catching o were favour so yours would i catch fair hermia ere i go my ear should catch your voice my eye your eye my tongue should catch your tongue s sweet melody were the world mine demetriu being bated the rest i d give to be to you translate o teach me how you look and with what art you sway the motion of demetriu heart hermia i frown upon him yet he love me still helena o that your frown would teach my smile such skill hermia i give him curse yet he give me love helena o that my prayer could such affection move hermia the more i hate the more he follow me helena the more i love the more he hateth me hermia his folly helena is no fault of mine helena none but your beauty would that fault were mine hermia take comfort he no more shall see my face lysander and myself will fly this place before the time i did lysander see seem d athens as a paradise to me o then what graces in my love do dwell that he hath turn d a heaven unto a hell lysander helen to you our mind we will unfold to morrow night when phoebe doth behold her silver visage in the watery glass deck with liquid pearl the blade grass a time that lovers flight doth still conceal through athens gate have we devise to steal hermia and in the wood where often you and i upon faint primrose bed were wont to lie empty our bosom of their counsel sweet there my lysander and myself shall meet and thence from athens turn away our eyes to seek new friends and stranger company farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us and good luck grant thee thy demetriu keep word lysander we must starve our sight from lovers food till morrow deep midnight lysander i will my hermia exit hermia helena adieu as you on him demetriu dote on you exit helena how happy some o er other some can be through athens i am thought as fair as she but what of that demetriu think not so he will not know what all but he do know and as he err doting on hermia s eyes so i admire of his quality things base and vile fold no quantity love can transpose to form and dignity love looks not with the eyes but with the mind and therefore is wing d cupid paint blind nor hath love s mind of any judgement taste wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste and therefore is love said to be a child because in choice he is so oft beguile as waggish boys in game themselves forswear so the boy love is perjure every where for ere demetriu look d on hermia s eyne he hail d down oath that he was only mine and when this hail some heat from hermia felt so he dissolve and shower of oath did melt i will go tell him of fair hermia s flight then to the wood will he to morrow night pursue her and for this intelligence if i have thanks it is a dear expense but herein mean i to enrich my pain to have his sight thither and back again exit

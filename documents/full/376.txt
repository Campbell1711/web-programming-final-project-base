forth  what say my general cassius messala this is my birth day as this very day was cassius born give me thy hand messala be thou my witness that against my will as pompey was am i compell d to set upon one battle all our liberties you know that i held epicuru strong and his opinion now i change my mind and partly credit things that do presage coming from sardi on our former ensign two mighty eagle fell and there they perch d gorge and feed from our soldier hand who to philippi here consort us this morning are they flee away and gone and in their stead do raven crow and kite fly o er our head and downward look on us as we were sickly prey their shadow seem a canopy most fatal under which our army lie ready to give up the ghost messala believe not so cassius i but believe it partly for i am fresh of spirit and resolve to meet all peril very constant brutu even so luciliu cassius now most noble brutu the gods to day stand friendly that we may lovers in peace lead on our days to age but since the affair of men rest still incertain let s reason with the worst that may befall if we do lose this battle then is this the very last time we shall speak together what are you then determined to do brutu even by the rule of that philosophy by which i did blame cato for the death which he did give himself i know not how but i do find it cowardly and vile for fear of what might fall so to prevent the time of life arm myself with patience to stay the providence of some high powers that govern us below cassius then if we lose this battle you are contented to be led in triumph thorough the street of rome brutu no cassius no think not thou noble roman that ever brutu will go bound to rome he bear too great a mind but this same day must end that work the ides of march begun and whether we shall meet again i know not therefore our everlasting farewell take for ever and for ever farewell cassius if we do meet again why we shall smile if not why then this parting was well made cassius for ever and for ever farewell brutu if we do meet again we ll smile indeed if not tis true this parting was well made brutu why then lead on o that a man might know the end of this day s business ere it come but it sufficeth that the day will end and then the end is known come ho away exeunt

do but lift this arm the best of you shall sink in my rebuke give me to know how this foul rout began who set it on and he that is approve in this offence though he had twinn d with me both at a birth shall lose me what in a town of war yet wild the people s heart brimful of fear to manage private and domestic quarrel in night and on the court and guard of safety  tis monstrous iago who began t montano if partially affine or league in office thou dost deliver more or less than truth thou art no soldier iago touch me not so near i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offence to michael cassio yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him thus it is general montano and myself being in speech there come a fellow crying out for help and cassio following him with determined sword to execute upon him sir this gentleman steps in to cassio and entreat his pause myself the crying fellow did pursue lest by his clamour as it so fell out the town might fall in fright he swift of foot outran my purpose and i return d the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of sword and cassio high in oath which till to night i ne er might say before when i came back for this was brief i found them close together at blow and thrust even as again they were when you yourself did part them more of this matter cannot i report but men are men the best sometimes forget though cassio did some little wrong to him as men in rage strike those that wish them best yet surely cassio i believe received from him that flee some strange indignity which patience could not pass othello i know iago thy honesty and love doth mince this matter making it light to cassio cassio i love thee but never more be officer of mine re enter desdemona attend look if my gentle love be not raise up i ll make thee an example desdemona what s the matter othello all s well now sweet come away to bed sir for your hurt myself will be your surgeon lead him off to montano

and cassio iago what are you hurt lieutenant cassio ay past all surgery iago marry heaven forbid cassio reputation reputation reputation o i have lost my reputation i have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial my reputation iago my reputation iago as i am an honest man i thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser what man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and he s yours cassio i will rather sue to be despise than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with one s own shadow o thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil iago what was he that you follow with your sword what had he done to you cassio i know not iago is t possible cassio i remember a mass of things but nothing distinct a quarrel but nothing wherefore o god that men should put an enemy in their mouth to steal away their brains that we should with joy please revel and applause transform ourselves into beast iago why but you are now well enough how came you thus recover cassio it hath pleased the devil drunken to give place to the devil wrath one unperfect show me another to make me frankly despise myself iago come you are too severe a morale as the time the place and the condition of this country stand i could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good cassio i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me i am a drunkard had i as many mouth as hydra such an answer would stop them all to be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast o strange every inordinate cup is unbless and the ingredient is a devil iago come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well use exclaim no more against it and good lieutenant i think you think i love you cassio i have well approve it sir i drunk iago you or any man living may be drunk at a time man i ll tell you what you shall do our general s wife is now the general may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denote of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again she is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she hold it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is request this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortune against any lay worth name this crack of your love shall grow strong than it was before cassio you advise me well iago i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness cassio i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me i am desperate of my fortune if they cheque me here iago you are in the right good night lieutenant i must to the watch cassio good night honest iago exit iago and what s he then that say i play the villain when this advice is free i give and honest probe to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again for tis most easy the incline desdemona to subdue in any honest suit she s frame as fruitful as the free elements and then for her to win the moor were t to renounce his baptism all seal and symbol of redeem sin his soul is so enfetter d to her love that she may make unmake do what she list even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course directly to his good divinity of hell when devil will the blackest sin put on they do suggest at first with heavenly show as i do now for while this honest fool ply desdemona to repair his fortune and she for him plead strong to the moor i ll pour this pestilence into his ear that she repeal him for her body s lust and by how much she strive to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all re enter roderigo how now roderigo roderigo i do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunt but one that fill up the cry my money is almost spent i have been to night exceedingly well cudgel and i think the issue will be i shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to venice iago how poor are they that have not patience what wound did ever heal but by degree thou know st we work by wit and not by witchcraft and wit depend on dilatory time do t not go well cassio hath beaten thee and thou by that small hurt hast cashier d cassio though other things grow fair against the sun yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe content thyself awhile by the mass tis morning pleasure and action make the hour seem short retire thee go where thou art billet away i say thou shalt know more hereafter nay get thee gone exit roderigo two things are to be done my wife must move for cassio to her mistress i ll set her on myself the while to draw the moor apart and bring him jump when he may cassio find solicit his wife ay that s the way dull not device by cold and delay exit

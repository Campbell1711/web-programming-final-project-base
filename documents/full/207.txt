unknit that threaten unkind brow and dart not scornful glance from those eyes to wound thy lord thy king thy governor it blot thy beauty as frost do bite the mead confound thy fame as whirlwind shake fair bud and in no sense is meet or amiable a woman move is like a fountain trouble muddy ill seeming thick bereft of beauty and while it is so none so dry or thirsty will deign to sip or touch one drop of it thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper thy head thy sovereign one that care for thee and for thy maintenance commit his body to painful labour both by sea and land to watch the night in storm the day in cold whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe and crave no other tribute at thy hand but love fair looks and true obedience too little payment for so great a debt such duty as the subject owe the prince even such a woman oweth to her husband and when she is froward peevish sullen sour and not obedient to his honest will what is she but a foul contend rebel and graceless traitor to her loving lord i am ashamed that women are so simple to offer war where they should kneel for peace or seek for rule supremacy and sway when they are bound to serve love and obey why are our body soft and weak and smooth unapt to toil and trouble in the world but that our soft conditions and our heart should well agree with our external parts come come you froward and unable worm my mind hath been as big as one of yours my heart as great my reason haply more to bandy word for word and frown for frown but now i see our lance are but straw our strength as weak our weakness past compare that seeming to be most which we indeed least are then vail your stomach for it is no boot and place your hand below your husband s foot in token of which duty if he please my hand is ready may it do him ease petruchio why there s a wench come on and kiss me kate lucentio well go thy ways old lad for thou shalt ha t vincentio  tis a good hearing when children are toward lucentio but a harsh hearing when women are froward petruchio come kate we ll to bed we three are married but you two are sped to lucentio  twa i won the wager though you hit the white and being a winner god give you good night exeunt petruchio and katharina hortensio now go thy ways thou hast tame a curst shrew lucentio  tis a wonder by your leave she will be tame so exeunt

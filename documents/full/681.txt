tent please it our general to pass strange by him as if he were forgot and prince all lay negligent and loose regard upon him i will come last tis like he ll question me why such unplausive eyes are bent on him if so i have derision medicine to use between your strange and his pride which his own will shall have desire to drink it may be good pride hath no other glass to show itself but pride for

do you exit achilles what do the cuckold scorn me ajax how now patroclu achilles good morrow ajax ajax ha achilles good morrow ajax ay and good next day too exit achilles what mean these fellow know they not achilles patroclu they pass by strange they were use to bend to send their smile before them to achilles to come as humble as they use to creep to holy altar achilles what am i poor of late  tis certain great once fall n out with fortune must fall out with men too what the decline is he shall as soon read in the eyes of other as feel in his own fall for men like butterfly show not their mealy wings but to the summer and not a man for being simply man hath any honour but honour for those honours that are without him as place riches favour prize of accident as oft as merit which when they fall as being slippery stand the love that lean d on them as slippery too do one pluck down another and together die in the fall but tis not so with me fortune and i are friends i do enjoy at ample point all that i did possess save these men s looks who do methinks find out something not worth in me such rich behold as they have often given here is ulysse i ll interrupt his reading how now ulysse ulysse now great theti son achilles what are you reading ulysse a strange fellow here write me that man how dearly ever part how much in have or without or in cannot make boast to have that which he hath nor feel not what he owe but by reflection as when his virtue shining upon other heat them and they retort that heat again to the first give achilles this is not strange ulysse the beauty that is borne here in the face the bearer know not but commend itself to other eyes nor doth the eye itself that most pure spirit of sense behold itself not go from itself but eye to eye oppose salute each other with each other s form for speculation turn not to itself till it hath travell d and is mirror d there where it may see itself this is not strange at all ulysse i do not strain at the position it is familiar but at the author s drift who in his circumstance expressly prove that no man is the lord of any thing though in and of him there be much consist till he communicate his parts to other nor doth he of himself know them for aught till he behold them form d in the applause where they re extend who like an arch reverberate the voice again or like a gate of steel front the sun receive and render back his figure and his heat i was much wrapt in this and apprehend here immediately the unknown ajax heaven what a man is there a very horse that has he know not what nature what things there are most abject in regard and dear in use what things again most dear in the esteem and poor in worth now shall we see to morrow an act that very chance doth throw upon him ajax renown d o heaven what some men do while some men leave to do how some men creep in skittish fortune s hall while other play the idiot in her eyes how one man eats into another s pride while pride is fast in his wanton to see these grecian lords why even already they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder as if his foot were on brave hector s breast and great troy shriek achilles i do believe it for they pass d by me as miser do by beggar neither gave to me good word nor look what are my deed forgot ulysse time hath my lord a wallet at his back wherein he put alms for oblivion a great size monster of ingratitude those scraps are good deed past which are devour d as fast as they are made forgot as soon as done perseverance dear my lord keeps honour bright to have done is to hang quite out of fashion like a rusty mail in monumental mockery take the instant way for honour travels in a strait so narrow where one but go abreast keep then the path for emulation hath a thousand son that one by one pursue if you give way or hedge aside from the direct forthright like to an enter d tide they all rush by and leave you hindmost or like a gallant horse fall n in first rank lie there for pavement to the abject rear o er run and trample on then what they do in present though less than yours in past must o ertop yours for time is like a fashionable host that slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand and with his arms outstretch d as he would fly grasp in the comer welcome ever smile and farewell go out sigh o let not virtue seek remunerate for the thing it was for beauty wit high birth vigour of bone desert in service love friendship charity are subject all to envious and calumniate time one touch of nature make the whole world kin that all with one consent praise new born gawd though they are made and mould of things past and give to dust that is a little gilt more laud than gilt o er dust the present eye praises the present object then marvel not thou great and complete man that all the greece begin to worship ajax since things in motion soon catch the eye than what not stir the cry went once on thee and still it might and yet it may again if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive and case thy reputation in thy tent whose glorious deed but in these field of late made emulous mission mongst the gods themselves and drave great mars to faction achilles of this my privacy i have strong reason ulysse but gainst your privacy the reason are more potent and heroic  tis known achilles that you are in love with one of priam s daughter achilles ha known ulysse is that a wonder the providence that s in a watchful state know almost every grain of plutu gold find bottom in the uncomprehensive deep keeps place with thought and almost like the gods do thought unveil in their dumb cradle there is a mystery with whom relation durst never meddle in the soul of state which hath an operation more divine than breath or pen can give expressure to all the commerce that you have had with troy as perfectly is ours as yours my lord and better would it fit achilles much to throw down hector than polyxena but it must grieve young pyrrhu now at home when fame shall in our island sound her trump and all the greekish girl shall tripping sing  great hector s sister did achilles win but our great ajax brave beat down him farewell my lord i as your lover speak the fool slide o er the ice that you should break exit patroclu to this effect achilles have i move you a woman impudent and mannish grown is not more loathe than an effeminate man in time of action i stand condemn d for this they think my little stomach to the war and your great love to me restrain you thus sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton cupid shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold and like a dew drop from the lion s mane be shook to air achilles shall ajax fight with hector patroclu ay and perhaps receive much honour by him achilles i see my reputation is at stake my fame is shrewd gore patroclu o then beware those wound heal ill that men do give themselves omission to do what is necessary seal a commission to a blank of danger and danger like an ague subtle taint even then when we sit idle in the sun achilles go call thersite hither sweet patroclu i ll send the fool to ajax and desire him to invite the trojan lords after the combat to see us here unarm d i have a woman s longing an appetite that i am sick withal to see great hector in his weeds of peace to talk with him and to behold his visage even to my full of view enter thersite a labour save thersite a wonder achilles what thersite ajax go up and down the field ask for himself achilles how so thersite he must fight singly to morrow with hector and is so prophetic proud of an heroic cudgel that he rave in saying nothing achilles how can that be thersite why he stalk up and down like a peacock a stride and a stand ruminate like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning bite his lip with a politic regard as who should say there were wit in this head an twould out and so there is but it lie as cold in him as fire in a flint which will not show without knock the man s undone forever for if hector break not his neck i the combat he ll break t himself in vain glory he know not me i said good morrow ajax and he reply thanks agamemnon what think you of this man that take me for the general he s grown a very land fish language less a monster a plague of opinion a man may wear it on both side like a leather jerkin achilles thou must be my ambassador to him thersite thersite who i why he ll answer nobody he profess not answer speak is for beggar he wear his tongue in s arms i will put on his presence let patroclu make demand to me you shall see the pageant of ajax achilles to him patroclu tell him i humble desire the valiant ajax to invite the most valorous hector to come unarmed to my tent and to procure safe conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious six or seven times honour captain general of the grecian army agamemnon et cetera do this patroclu jove bless great ajax thersite hum patroclu i come from the worthy achilles thersite ha patroclu who most humble desire you to invite hector to his tent thersite hum patroclu and to procure safe conduct from agamemnon thersite agamemnon patroclu ay my lord thersite

hector has knock out his brains i know not but i am sure none unless the fiddler apollo get his sinew to make catl on achilles come thou shalt bear a letter to him straight thersite let me bear another to his horse for that s the more capable creature achilles my mind is trouble like a fountain stirr d and i myself see not the bottom of it exeunt achilles and patroclu thersite would the fountain of your mind were clear again that i might water an ass at it i had rather be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance exit

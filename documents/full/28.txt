carmen whistle and swear they were his fancies or his good nights and now is this vice s dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of john a gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and i ll be sworn a ne er saw him but once in the tilt yard and then he burst his head for crowd among the marshal s men i saw it and told john a gaunt he beat his own name for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel skin the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a court and now has he land and beef well i ll be acquaint with him if i return and it shall go hard but i will make him a philosopher s two stone to me if the young dace be a bait for the old pike i see no reason in the law of nature but i may snap at him let time shape and there an end exit

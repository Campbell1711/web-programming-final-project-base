salisbury pride went before ambition follow him while these do labour for their own preferment behove it us to labour for the realm i never saw but humphrey duke of gloucester did bear him like a noble gentleman oft have i seen the haughty cardinal more like a soldier than a man o the church as stout and proud as he were lord of all swear like a ruffian and demean himself unlike the ruler of a commonweal warwick my son the comfort of my age thy deed thy plain and thy housekeeping hath won the greatest favour of the commons excepting none but good duke humphrey and brother york thy acts in

their own pirate may make cheap pennyworth of their pillage and purchase friends and give to courtezan still revel like lords till all be gone while as the silly owner of the goods weep over them and wring his hapless hand and shakes his head and tremble stand aloof while all is share and all is borne away ready to starve and dare not touch his own so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue while his own lands are bargain d for and sold methinks the realm of england france and ireland bear that proportion to my flesh and blood as did the fatal brand althaea burn d unto the prince s heart of calydon anjou and maine both given unto the france cold news for me for i had hope of france even as i have of fertile england s soil a day will come when york shall claim his own and therefore i will take the nevil parts and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey and when i spy advantage claim the crown for that s the golden mark i seek to hit nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist nor wear the diadem upon his head whose church like humour fit not for a crown then york be still awhile till time do serve watch thou and wake when other be asleep to pry into the secret of the state till henry surfeit in joy of love with his new bride and england s dear bought queen and humphrey with the peer be fall n at jar then will i raise aloft the milk white rose with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfume and in my standard bear the arms of york to grapple with the house of lancaster and force perforce i ll make him yield the crown whose bookish rule hath pull d fair england down exit

scene ii belmont a room in portia s house enter portia and nerissa portia by my troth nerissa my little body is aweary of this great world nerissa you would be sweet madam if your misery were in the same abundance as your good fortune are and yet for aught i see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing it is no mean happiness therefore to be seat in the mean superfluity come soon by white hair but competent lives long portia good sentence and well pronounced nerissa they would be better if well follow portia if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapel had been church and poor men s cottage prince palace it is a good divine that follow his own instruction i can easy teach twenty what were good to be done than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching the brain may devise law for the blood but a hot temper leap o er a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip o er the mesh of good counsel the cripple but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband o me the word choose i may neither choose whom i would nor refuse whom i dislike so is the will of a living daughter curb by the will of a dead father is it not hard nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none nerissa your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death have good inspiration therefore the lottery that he hath devise in these three chest of gold silver and lead whereof who choose his meaning choose you will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who shall rightly love but what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitor that are already come portia i pray thee over name them and as thou namest them i will describe them and according to my description level at my affection nerissa first there is the neapolitan prince portia ay that s a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he make it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself i am much afeard my lady his mother play false with a smith nerissa then there is the county palatine portia he doth nothing but frown as who should say if you will not have me choose he hear merry tale and smile not i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grow old being so full of unmannerly sad in his youth i had rather be married to a death s head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these god defend me from these two nerissa how say you by the france lord monsieur le bon portia god made him and therefore let him pass for a man in truth i know it is a sin to be a mock but he why he hath a horse better than the neapolitan s a better bad habit of frown than the count palatine he is every man in no man if a throstle sing he falls straight a caper he will fence with his own shadow if i should marry him i should marry twenty husband if he would despise me i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i shall never requite him nerissa what say you then to falconbridge the young baron of england portia you know i say nothing to him for he understand not me nor i him he hath neither latin france nor italy and you will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english he is a proper man s picture but alas who can converse with a dumb show how oddly he is suit i think he bought his doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet in germany and his behavior every where nerissa what think you of the scotland lord his neighbour portia that he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrow a box of the ear of the englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able i think the frenchman became his surety and seal under for another nerissa how like you the young germany the duke of saxony s nephew portia very vile in the morning when he is sober and most vile in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast and the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall make shift to go without him nerissa if he should offer to choose and choose the right casket you should refuse to perform your father s will if you should refuse to accept him portia therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without i know he will choose it i will do any thing nerissa ere i ll be married to a sponge nerissa you need not fear lady the have any of these lords they have acquaint me with their determination which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your father s imposition depend on the casket portia if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as chaste as diana unless i be obtain by the manner of my father s will i am glad this parcel of wooer are so reasonable for there is not one among them but i dote on his very absence and i pray god grant them a fair departure nerissa do you not remember lady in your father s time a venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of the marquis of montferrat portia yes yes it was bassanio as i think he was so call nerissa true madam he of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look upon was the best deserving a fair lady portia i remember him well and i remember him worthy of thy praise enter a serving man how now what news servant the four stranger seek for you madam to take their leave and there is a forerunner come from a fifth the prince of morocco who bring word the prince his master will be here to night portia if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should be glad of his approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil i had rather he should shrive me than wive me come nerissa sirrah go before while we shut the gate upon one wooer another knock at the door exeunt

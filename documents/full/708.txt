scene vi the english camp in picardy enter gower and fluellen meeting gower how now captain fluellen come you from the bridge fluellen i assure you there is very excellent service committed at the bridge gower is the duke of exeter safe fluellen the duke of exeter is as magnanimous as agamemnon and a man that i love and honour with my soul and my heart and my duty and my life and my living and my uttermost power he is not god be praise and blessed any hurt in the world but keeps the bridge most valiantly with excellent discipline there is an aunchient lieutenant there at the pridge i think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as mark antony and he is a man of no estimation in the world but did see him do as gallant service gower what do you call him fluellen he is call aunchient pistol gower i know him not enter pistol fluellen here is the man pistol captain i thee beseech to do me favours the duke of exeter doth love thee well fluellen ay i praise god and i have merit some love at his hand pistol bardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart and of buxom valour hath by cruel fate and giddy fortune s furious fickle wheel that goddess blind that stand upon the rolling restless stone fluellen by your patience aunchient pistol fortune is paint blind with a muffler afore her eyes to signify to you that fortune is blind and she is paint also with a wheel to signify to you which is the moral of it that she is turning and inconstant and mutable and variation and her foot look you is fixed upon a spherical stone which rolls and rolls and rolls in good truth the poet make a most excellent description of it fortune is an excellent moral pistol fortune is bardolph s foe and frown on him for he hath stolen a pax and hang must a be a damn death let gallows gape for dog let man go free and let not hemp his wind pipe suffocate but exeter hath given the doom of death for pax of little price therefore go speak the duke will hear thy voice and let not bardolph s vital thread be cut with edge of penny cord and vile reproach speak captain for his life and i will thee requite fluellen aunchient pistol i do partly understand your meaning pistol why then rejoice therefore fluellen certainly aunchient it is not a thing to rejoice at for if look you he were my brother i would desire the duke to use his good pleasure and put him to execution for discipline ought to be use pistol die and be damn d and figo for thy friendship fluellen it is well pistol the fig of spain exit fluellen very good gower why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal i remember him now a

they con perfectly in the phrase of war which they trick up with new tune oath and what a beard of the general s cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foam bottle and ale wash wit is wonderful to be thought on but you must learn to know such slander of the age or else you may be marvellous mistook fluellen i tell you what captain gower i do perceive he is not the man that he would

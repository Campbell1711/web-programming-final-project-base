and pore and thereon look for when would you my lord or you or you have found the ground of study s excellence without the beauty of a woman s face from women s eyes this doctrine i derive they are the ground the books the academe from whence doth spring the true promethean fire why universal plod poison up the nimble spirits in the artery as motion and long during action tire the sinewy vigour of the traveller now for not look on a woman s face you have in that forsworn the use of eyes and study too the cause of your vow for where is any author in the world teach such beauty as a woman s eye learning is but an adjunct to ourself and where we are our learning likewise is then when ourselves we see in ladies eyes do we not likewise see our learning there o we have made a vow to study lords and in that vow we have forsworn our books for when would you my liege or you or you in leaden contemplation have found out such fiery numbers as the prompt eyes of beauty s tutor have enrich d you with other slow arts entire keep the brain and therefore finding barren practise scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil but love first learned in a lady s eyes lives not alone immure in the

savage ear and plant in tyrant mild humility from women s eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books the arts the academe that show contain and nourish all the world else none at all in ought prove excellent then fool you were these women to forswear or keeping what is sworn you will prove fool for wisdom s sake a word that all men love or for love s sake a word that love all men or for men s sake the author of these women or women s sake by whom we men are men let us once lose our oath to find ourselves or else we lose ourselves to keep our oath

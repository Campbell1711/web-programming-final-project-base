frown d he once when in an angry parle he smote the sled polack on the ice  tis strange marcellu thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch horatio in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bode some strange eruption to our state marcellu good now sit down and tell me he that know why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implement of war why such impress of shipwright whose sore task do not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint labourer with the day who is t that can inform me horatio that can i at least the whisper go so our last king whose image even but now appear d to us was as you know by fortinbra of norway thereto prick d on by a most emulate pride dare to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteem d him did slay this fortinbra who by a seal d compact well ratify by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seize of to the conquer against the which a moiety competent was gag by our king which had return d to the inheritance of fortinbra had he been vanquish as by the same covenant and carriage of the article design d his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbra of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirt of norway here and there shark d up a list of lawless resolute for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach in t which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparation the source of this our watch and the chief head of this post haste and romage in the land bernardo i think it be no other but e en so well may it sort that this portentous figure come armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these war horatio a mote it is to trouble the mind s eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the grave stood tenantless and the sheet dead did squeak and gibber in the roman street as stars with train of fire and dew of blood disaster in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptune s empire stand was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce event as harbinger preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrate unto our climature and countrymen but soft behold lo where it come again re enter ghost i ll cross it though it blast me stay illusion if thou

foreknowe may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarde in thy life extort treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak stop it marcellu marcellu shall i strike at it with my partisan horatio do if it will not stand bernardo  tis here horatio  tis here marcellu  tis gone exit ghost we do it wrong being so majestic to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blow malicious mockery bernardo it was about to speak when the cock crew horatio and then it start like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrill sound throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air the extravagant and err spirit hie to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation marcellu it fade on the crow of the cock some say that ever gainst that season come wherein our saviour s birth is celebrated the bird of dawn singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planet strike no fairy take nor witch hath power to charm so hallow d and so gracious is the time horatio so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walk o er the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen to night unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our love fitting our duty marcellu let s do t i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most convenient exeunt

scene ii the same the presence chamber enter king henry v gloucester bedford exeter warwick westmoreland and attendant king henry v where is my gracious lord of canterbury exeter not here in presence king henry v send for him good uncle westmoreland shall we call in the ambassador my liege king henry v not yet my cousin we would be resolve before we hear him of some things of weight that task our thought concerning us and france enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of e canterbury god and his angel guard your sacred throne and make you long become it king henry v sure we thank you my learned lord we pray you to proceed and just and religiously unfold why the law salique that they have in france or should or should not bar us in our claim and god forbid my dear and faithful lord that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading or nicely charge your understanding soul with opening title miscreate whose right suit not in native colours with the truth for god doth know how many now in health shall drop their blood in approbation of what your reverence shall incite us to therefore take heed how you impawn our person how you awake our sleep sword of war we charge you in the name of god take heed for never two such kingdom did contend without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops are every one a woe a sore complaint  gainst him whose wrong give edge unto the sword that make such waste in brief mortality under this conjure speak my lord for we will hear note and believe in heart that what you speak is in your conscience wash d as pure as sin with baptism canterbury then hear me gracious sovereign and you peer that owe yourself your lives and service to this imperial throne there is no bar to make against your highness claim to france but this which they produce from pharamond  in terram salicam muliere ne succedant  no woman shall succeed in salique land which salique land the france unjust gloze to be the realm of france and pharamond the founder of this law and female bar yet their own author faithfully affirm that the land salique is in germany between the flood of sala and of elbe where charles the great have subdued the saxon there left behind and settled certain france who holding in disdain the germany women for some dishonest manners of their life establish d then this law to wit no female should be inheritrix in salique land which salique as i said twixt elbe and sala is at this day in germany call d meisen then doth it well appear that salique law was not devise for the realm of france nor did the france possess the salique land until four hundred one and twenty years after defunct of king pharamond idle supposed the founder of this law who die within the year of our redemption four hundred twenty six and charles the great subdued the saxon and did seat the france beyond the river sala in the year eight hundred five besides their writer say king pepin which depose childeric did as heir general being descended of blithild which was daughter to king clothair make claim and title to the crown of france hugh capet also who usurp the crown of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male of the true line and stock of charles the great to find his title with some show of truth  through in pure truth it was corrupt and naught convey d himself as heir to the lady lingare daughter to charlemain who was the son to lewis the emperor and lewis the son of charles the great also king lewis the tenth who was sole heir to the usurp capet could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of france till satisfy that fair queen isabel his grandmother was lineal of the lady ermengare daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine by the which marriage the line of charles the great was re united to the crown of france so that as clear as is the summer s sun king pepin s title and hugh capet s claim king lewis his satisfaction all appear to hold in right and title of the female so do the kings of france unto this day howbeit they would hold up this salique law to bar your highness claim from the female and rather choose to hide them in a net than ample to imbar their crooked title usurp d from you and your progenitor king henry v may i with right and conscience make this claim canterbury the sin upon my head dread sovereign for in the book of numbers is it writ when the man die let the inheritance descend unto the daughter gracious lord stand for your own unwind your bloody flag look back into your mighty ancestor go my dread lord to your great grandsire s tomb from whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit and your great uncle s edward the black prince who on the france ground play d a tragedy making defeat on the full power of france while his most mighty father on a hill stood smile to behold his lion s whelp forage in blood of france nobility o noble english that could entertain with half their forces the full pride of france and let another half stand laugh by all out of work and cold for action e awake remembrance of these valiant dead and with your puissant arm renew their feat you are their heir you sit upon their throne the blood and courage that renowned them runs in your vein and my thrice puissant liege is in the very may morn of his youth ripe for exploit and mighty enterprise exeter your brother kings and monarch of the earth do all expect that you should rouse yourself as did the former lion of your blood westmoreland they know your grace hath cause and means and might so hath your highness never king of england had noble rich and more loyal subject whose heart have left their body here in england and lie pavilion d in the field of france canterbury o let their body follow my dear liege with blood and sword and fire to win your right in aid whereof we of the spiritualty will raise your highness such a mighty sum as never did the clergy at one time bring in to any of your ancestor king henry v we must not only arm to invade the france but lay down our proportions to defend against the scot who will make road upon us with all advantage canterbury they of those march gracious sovereign shall be a wall sufficient to defend our inland from the pilfer borderer king henry v we do not mean the coursing snatch only but fear the main intend of the scot who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us for you shall read that my great grandfather never went with his forces into france but that the scot on his unfurnish d kingdom came pour like the tide into a breach with ample and brim fulness of his force gall the glean land with hot assay gird with grievous siege castle and town that england being empty of defence hath shook and tremble at the ill neighbourhood canterbury she hath been then more fear d than harm d my liege for hear her but example by herself when all her chivalry hath been in france and she a mourning widow of her noble she hath herself not only well defend but taken and impound as a stray the king of scot whom she did send to france to fill king edward s fame with prisoner kings and make her chronicle as rich with praise as is the ooze and bottom of the sea with sunken wreck and sunless treasury westmoreland but there s a saying very old and true  if that you will france win then with scotland first begin for once the eagle england being in prey to her unguarded nest the weasel scot come sneaking and so suck her princely egg play the mouse in absence of the cat to tear and havoc more than she can eat exeter it follow then the cat must stay at home yet that is but a crush d necessity since we have locks to safeguard necessaries and pretty trap to catch the petty thief while that the armed hand doth fight abroad the advise head defend itself at home for government though high and low and lower put into parts doth keep in one consent congreee in a full and natural close like music canterbury therefore doth heaven divide the state of man in divers function setting endeavour in continual motion to which is fixed as an aim or butt obedience for so work the honey bee creature that by a rule in nature teach the act of order to a people kingdom they have a king and officer of sort where some like magistrate correct at home other like merchant venture trade abroad other like soldier armed in their sting make boot upon the summer s velvet bud which pillage they with merry march bring home to the tent royal of their emperor who busy in his majesty survey the singing mason building roof of gold the civil citizen knead up the honey the poor mechanic porter crowd in their heavy burden at his narrow gate the sad eye justice with his surly hum deliver o er to executor pale the lazy yawn drone i this infer that many things have full reference to one consent may work contrarious as many arrow loose several ways come to one mark as many ways meet in one town as many fresh stream meet in one salt sea as many lines close in the dial s centre so may a thousand action once afoot end in one purpose and be all well borne without defeat therefore to france my liege divide your happy england into four whereof take you one quarter into france and you withal shall make all gallia shake if we with thrice such powers left at home cannot defend our own door from the dog let us be worried and our nation lose the name of hardiness and policy king henry v call in the messenger sent from the dauphin exeunt some attendant now are we well resolve and by god s help and yours the noble sinew of our power france being ours we ll bend it to our awe or break it all to pieces or there we ll sit ruling in large and ample empery o er france and all her almost kingly dukedom or lay these bone in an unworthy urn tombless with no remembrance over them either our history shall with full mouth speak freely of our acts or else our grave like turkey mute shall have a tongueless mouth not worshipp d with a waxen epitaph enter ambassador of france now are we well prepared to know the pleasure of our fair cousin dauphin for we hear your greeting is from him not from the king first ambassador may t please your majesty to give us leave freely to render what we have in charge or shall we sparing show you far off the dauphin s meaning and our embassy king henry v we are no tyrant but a christian king unto whose grace our passion is as subject as are our wretch fetter d in our prison therefore with frank and with uncurbed plain tell us the dauphin s mind first ambassador thus then in few your highness lately send into france did claim some certain dukedom in the right of your great predecessor king edward the third in answer of which claim the prince our master say that you savour too much of your youth and bid you be advise there s nought in france that can be with a nimble galliard won you cannot revel into dukedom there he therefore send you meet for your spirit this tun of treasure and in lieu of this desire you let the dukedom that you claim hear no more of you this the dauphin speak king henry v what treasure uncle exeter tennis balls my liege king henry v we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us his present and your pains we thank you for when we have march d our rackets to these balls we will in france by god s grace play a set shall strike his father s crown into the hazard tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler that all the court of france will be disturb d with chace and we understand him well how he come o er us with our wild days not measure what use we made of them we never value this poor seat of england and therefore living hence did give ourself to barbarous licence as tis ever common that men are merriest when they are from home but tell the dauphin i will keep my state be like a king and show my sail of great when i do rouse me in my throne of france for that i have laid by my majesty and plod like a man for working days but i will rise there with so full a glory that i will dazzle all the eyes of france yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his hath turn d his balls to gun stone and his soul shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them for many a thousand widow shall this his mock mock out of their dear husband mock mother from their son mock castle down and some are yet ungotten and unborn that shall have cause to curse the dauphin s scorn but this lie all within the will of god to whom i do appeal and in whose name tell you the dauphin i am coming on to venge me as i may and to put forth my rightful hand in a well hallow d cause so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin his jest will savour but of shallow wit when thousand weep more than did laugh at it convey them with safe conduct fare you well exeunt ambassador exeter this was a merry message king henry v we hope to make the sender blush at it therefore my lords omit no happy hour that may give furtherance to our expedition for we have now no thought in us but france save those to god that run before our business therefore let our proportions for these war be soon collected and all things thought upon that may with reasonable swift add more feather to our wings for god before we ll chide this dauphin at his father s door therefore let every man now task his thought that this fair action may on foot be brought exeunt flourish

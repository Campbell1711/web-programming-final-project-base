to day a wife and my election is led on in the conduct of my will my will enkindle by mine eyes and ear two trade pilot twixt the dangerous shore of will and judgment how may i avoid although my will distaste what it elect the wife i chose there can be no evasion to blench from this and to stand firm by honour we turn not back the silk upon the merchant when we have soil d them nor the remainder viands we do not throw in unrespective sieve because we now are full it was thought meet paris should do some vengeance on the greece your breath of full consent belly his sail the sea and wind old

hector now youthful troilu do not these high strain of divination in our sister work some touch of remorse or is your blood so madly hot that no discourse of reason nor fear of bad success in a bad cause can qualify the same troilu why brother hector we may not think the just of each act such and no other than event doth form it nor once deject the courage of our mind because cassandra s mad her brain sick rapture cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel which hath our several honours all engaged to make it gracious for my private part i am no more touch d than all priam s son and jove forbid there should be done amongst us such things as might offend the weakest spleen to fight for and maintain paris else might the world convince of levity as well my undertaking as your counsel but i attest the gods your full consent gave wings to my propension and cut off all fear attend on so dire a project for what alas can these my single arms what propugnation is in one man s valour to stand the push and enmity of those this quarrel would excite yet i protest were i alone to pass the difficulty and had as ample power as i have will paris should ne er retract what he hath done nor faint in the pursuit priam paris you speak like one besotted on your sweet delight you have the honey still but these the gall so to be valiant is no praise at all paris sir i propose not merely to myself the pleasure such a beauty bring with it but i would have the soil of her fair rape wipe off in honourable keeping her what treason were it to the ransack d queen disgrace to your great worth and shame to me now to deliver her possession up on terms of base compulsion can it be that so degenerate a strain as this should once set footing in your generous bosom there s not the meanest spirit on our party without a heart to dare or sword to draw when helen is defend nor none so noble whose life were ill bestow d or death unfamed where helen is the subject then i say well may we fight for her whom we know well the world s large space cannot parallel hector paris and troilu you have both said well and on the cause and question now in hand have gloze but superficial not much unlike young men whom aristotle thought unfit to hear moral philosophy the reason you allege do more conduce to the hot passion of distemper d blood than to make up a free determination  twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge have ear more deaf than adder to the voice of any true decision nature crave all dues be render d to their owner now what near debt in all humanity than wife is to the husband if this law of nature be corrupt through affection and that great mind of partial indulgence to their benumbed will resist the same there is a law in each well order d nation to curb those rage appetite that are most disobedient and refractory if helen then be wife to sparta s king as it is known she is these moral law of nature and of nation speak aloud to have her back return d thus to persist in do wrong extenuate not wrong but make it much more heavy hector s opinion is this in way of truth yet ne ertheless my sprite brethren i propend to you in resolution to keep helen still for tis a cause that hath no mean depend upon our joint and several dignity troilu why there you touch d the life of our design were it not glory that we more affected than the performance of our heave spleen i would not wish a drop of trojan blood spent more in her defence but worthy hector she is a theme of honour and renown a spur to valiant and magnanimous deed whose present courage may beat down our foe and fame in time to come canonize us for i presume brave hector would not lose so rich advantage of a promise glory as smile upon the forehead of this action for the wide world s revenue hector i am yours you valiant offspring of great priamu i have a roist challenge sent amongst the dun and factious noble of the greece will strike amaze to their drowsy spirits i was advertise their great general slept

scene i london the palace enter gloucester clarence somerset and montague gloucester now tell me brother clarence what think you of this new marriage with the lady grey hath not our brother made a worthy choice clarence alas you know tis far from hence to france how could he stay till warwick made return somerset my lords forbear this talk here come the king gloucester and his well chosen bride clarence i mind to tell him plainly what i think flourish enter king edward iv attend queen elizabeth pembroke stafford hastings and other king edward iv now brother of clarence how like you our choice that you stand pensive as half malcontent clarence as well as lewis of france or the earl of warwick which are so weak of courage and in judgment that they ll take no offence at our abuse king edward iv suppose they take offence without a cause they are but lewis and warwick i am edward your king and warwick s and must have my will gloucester and shall have your will because our king yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well king edward iv yea brother richard are you offend too gloucester not i no god forbid that i should wish them sever d whom god hath join d together ay and twere pity to sunder them that yoke so well together king edward iv setting your scorn and your mislike aside tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and england s queen and you too somerset and montague speak freely what you think clarence then this is mine opinion that king lewis become your enemy for mock him about the marriage of the lady bona gloucester and warwick do what you gave in charge is now dishonour by this new marriage king edward iv what if both lewis and warwick be appease by such invention as i can devise montague yet to have join d with france in such alliance would more have strengthen d this our commonwealth  gainst foreign storm than any home bred marriage hastings why know not montague that of itself england is safe if true within itself montague but the safe when tis back d with france hastings  tis better use france than trust france let us be back d with god and with the sea which he hath given for fence impregnable and with their help only defend ourselves in them and in ourselves our safety lie clarence for this one speech lord hastings well deserve to have the heir of the lord hungerford king edward iv ay what of that it was my will and grant and for this once my will shall stand for law gloucester and yet methinks your grace hath not done well to give the heir and daughter of lord scale unto the brother of your loving bride she better would have fitted me or clarence but in your bride you bury brotherhood clarence or else you would not have bestow d the heir of the lord bonville on your new wife s son and leave your brother to go speed elsewhere king edward iv alas poor clarence is it for a wife that thou art malcontent i will provide thee clarence in choose for yourself you show d your judgment which being shallow you give me leave to play the broker in mine own behalf and to that end i shortly mind to leave you king edward iv leave me or tarry edward will be king and not be tie unto his brother s will queen elizabeth my lords before it pleased his majesty to raise my state to title of a queen do me but right and you must all confess that i was not ignoble of descent and mean than myself have had like fortune but as this title honours me and mine so your dislike to whom i would be pleasing doth cloud my joy with danger and with sorrow king edward iv my love forbear to fawn upon their frown what danger or what sorrow can befall thee so long as edward is thy constant friend and their true sovereign whom they must obey nay whom they shall obey and love thee too unless they seek for hatred at my hand which if they do yet will i keep thee safe and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath gloucester aside  i hear yet say not much but think the more enter a post king edward iv now messenger what letters or what news from france post my sovereign liege no letters and few words but such as i without your special pardon dare not relate king edward iv go to we pardon thee therefore in brief tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them what answer make king lewis unto our letters post at my depart these were his very words  go tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is send over masque to revel it with him and his new bride king edward iv is lewis so brave belike he think me henry but what said lady bona to my marriage post these were her words utter d with mad disdain  tell him in hope he ll prove a widower shortly i ll wear the willow garland for his sake king edward iv i blame not her she could say little less she had the wrong but what said henry s queen for i have heard that she was there in place post  tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done and i am ready to put armour on king edward iv belike she mind to play the amazon but what said warwick to these injury post he more incense against your majesty than all the rest discharge me with these words  tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i ll uncrown him ere t be long king edward iv ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words well i will arm me being thus forewarn d they shall have war and pay for their presumption but say is warwick friends with margaret post ay gracious sovereign they are so link d in friendship that young prince edward marry warwick s daughter clarence belike the elder clarence will have the younger now brother king farewell and sit you fast for i will hence to warwick s other daughter that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage i may not prove inferior to yourself you that love me and warwick follow me exit clarence and somerset follow gloucester aside  not i my thought aim at a further matter i stay not for the love of edward but the crown king edward iv clarence and somerset both gone to warwick yet am i arm d against the worst can happen and haste is needful in this desperate case pembroke and stafford you in our behalf go levy men and make prepare for war they are already or quick will be landed myself in person will straight follow you exeunt pembroke and stafford but ere i go hastings and montague resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest are near to warwick by blood and by alliance tell me if you love warwick more than me if it be so then both depart to him i rather wish you foe than hollow friends but if you mind to hold your true obedience give me assurance with some friendly vow that i may never have you in suspect montague so god help montague as he prove true hastings and hastings as he favours edward s cause king edward iv now brother richard will you stand by us gloucester ay in despite of all that shall withstand you king edward iv why so then am i sure of victory now therefore let us hence and lose no hour till we meet warwick with his foreign power exeunt

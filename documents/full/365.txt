scene iii the same a street thunder and lightning enter from opposite side casca with his sword drawn and cicero cicero good even casca brought you caesar home why are you breathless and why stare you so casca are not you move when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm o cicero i have seen tempest when the scold wind have rive the knotty oak and i have seen the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam to be exalted with the threaten cloud but never till to night never till now did i go through a tempest drop fire either there is a civil strife in heaven or else the world too saucy with the gods incense them to send destruction cicero why saw you any thing more wonderful casca a common slave you know him well by sight held up his left hand which did flame and burn like twenty torch join d and yet his hand not sensible of fire remain d unscorch d besides i ha not since put up my sword against the capitol i met a lion who glare upon me and went surly by without annoy me and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women transform with their fear who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the street and yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noon day upon the market place hoot and shriek when these prodigy do so conjoint meet let not men say  these are their reason they are natural for i believe they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon cicero indeed it is a strange disposed time but men may construe things after their fashion clean from the purpose of the things themselves come caesar to the capitol to morrow casca he doth for he did bid antoniu send word to you he would be there to morrow cicero good night then casca this disturbed sky is not to walk in casca farewell cicero exit cicero enter cassius cassius who s there casca a roman cassius casca by your voice casca your ear is good cassius what night is this cassius a very pleasing night to honest men casca who ever knew the heaven menace so cassius those that have known the earth so full of fault for my part i have walk d about the street submit me unto the perilous night and thus unbraced casca as you see have bare my bosom to the thunder stone and when the cross blue lightning seem d to open the breast of heaven i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it casca but wherefore did you so much tempt the heaven it is the part of men to fear and tremble when the most mighty gods by token send such dreadful herald to astonish us cassius you are dull casca and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want or else you use not you look pale and gaze and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder to see the strange impatience of the heaven but if you would consider the true cause why all these fire why all these gliding ghost why bird and beast from quality and kind why old men fool and children calculate why all these things change from their ordinance their nature and preforme faculty to monstrous quality why you shall find that heaven hath infuse them with these spirits to make them instrument of fear and warning unto some monstrous state now could i casca name to thee a man most like this dreadful night that thunder lighten open grave and roar as doth the lion in the capitol a man no mighty than thyself or me in personal action yet prodigious grown and fearful as these strange eruption are casca  tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius cassius let it be who it is for roman now have thews and limb like to their ancestor but woe the while our father mind are dead and we are govern d with our mother spirits our yoke and sufferance show us womanish casca indeed they say the senator tomorrow mean to establish caesar as a king and he shall wear his crown by sea and land in every place save here in italy cassius i know where i will wear this dagger then cassius from bondage will deliver cassius therein ye gods you make the weak most strong therein ye gods you tyrant do defeat nor stony tower nor wall of beaten brass nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit but life being weary of these worldly bar never lack power to dismiss itself if i know this know all the world besides that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure thunder still casca so can i so every bondman in his own hand bear the power to cancel his captivity cassius and why should caesar be a tyrant then poor man i know he would not be a wolf but that he see the roman are but sheep he were no lion were not roman hind those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straw what trash is rome what rubbish and what offal when it serve for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar but o grief where hast thou led me i perhaps speak this before a willing bondman then i know my answer must be made but i am arm d and danger are to me indifferent casca you speak to casca and to such a man that is no fleere tell tale hold my hand be factious for redress of all these grief and i will set this foot of mine as far as who go farthest cassius there s a bargain made now know you casca i have move already some

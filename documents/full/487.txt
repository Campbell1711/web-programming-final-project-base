isabel heaven in my mouth as if i did but only chew his name and in my heart the strong and swelling evil of my conception the state whereon i studied is like a good thing being often read grown fear d and tedious yea my gravity wherein let no man hear me i take pride could i with boot change for an idle plume which the air beat for vain o place o form how often dost thou with thy case thy habit wrench awe from fool and tie the wise soul to thy false seeming blood thou art blood let s write good angel on the devil s horn  tis not the devil s crest enter a servant how now who s there servant one isabel a sister desire access to you angelo teach her the way exit servant o heaven why do my blood thus muster to my heart making both it unable for itself and dispossess all my other parts of necessary fitness so play the foolish throng with one that swoon come all to help him and so stop the air by which he should revive and even so the general subject to a well wish d king quit their own part and in obsequious fond crowd to his presence where their untaught love must needs appear offence enter isabella how now fair maid isabella i am come to know your pleasure angelo that you might know it would much better please me than to demand what tis your brother cannot live isabella even so heaven keep your honour angelo yet may he live awhile and it may be as long as you or i yet he must die isabella under your sentence angelo yea isabella when i beseech you that in his reprieve long or short he may be so fitted that his soul sicken not angelo ha fie these filthy vice it were as good to pardon him that hath from nature stolen a man already made as to remit their saucy sweet that do coin heaven s image in stamp that are forbid tis all as easy false to take away a life true made as to put metal in restrained means to make a false one isabella  tis set down so in heaven but not in earth angelo say you so then i shall pose you quick which had you rather that the most just law now took your brother s life or to redeem him give up your body to such sweet unclean as she that he hath stain d isabella sir believe this i had rather give my body than my soul angelo i talk not of your soul our compell d sin stand more for number than for accompt isabella how say you angelo nay i ll not warrant that for i can speak against the thing i say answer to this i now the voice of the record law pronounce a sentence on your brother s life might there not be a charity in sin to save this brother s life isabella please you to do t i ll take it as a peril to my soul it is no sin at all but charity angelo pleased you to do t at peril of your soul were equal poise of sin and charity isabella that i do beg his life if it be sin heaven let me bear it you grant of my suit if that

not good isabella let me be ignorant and in nothing good but gracious to know i am no better angelo thus wisdom wish to appear most bright when it doth tax itself as these black mask proclaim an enshield beauty ten times loud than beauty could display d but mark me to be received plain i ll speak more gross your brother is to die isabella so angelo and his offence is so as it appear accountant to the law upon that pain isabella true angelo admit no other way to save his life as i subscribe not that nor any other but in the loss of question that you his sister finding yourself desire of such a person whose credit with the judge or own great place could fetch your brother from the manacle of the all building law and that there were no earthly mean to save him but that either you must lay down the treasure of your body to this supposed or else to let him suffer what would you do isabella as much for my poor brother as myself that is were i under the terms of death the impression of keen whip i ld wear as ruby and strip myself to death as to a bed that longing have been sick for ere i ld yield my body up to shame angelo then must your brother die isabella and twere the cheap way better it were a brother die at once than that a sister by redeem him should die for ever angelo were not you then as cruel as the sentence that you have slander d so isabella ignomy in ransom and free pardon are of two house lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption angelo you seem d of late to make the law a tyrant and rather prove the slide of your brother a merriment than a vice isabella o pardon me my lord it oft falls out to have what we would have we speak not what we mean i something do excuse the thing i hate for his advantage that i dearly love angelo we are all frail isabella else let my brother die if not a feodary but only he owe and succeed thy weakness angelo nay women are frail too isabella ay as the glasses where they view themselves which are as easy broke as they make form women help heaven men their creation mar in profit by them nay call us ten times frail for we are soft as our complexion are and credulous to false print angelo i think it well and from this testimony of your own sex since i suppose we are made to be no strong than fault may shake our frames let me be bold i do arrest your words be that you are that is a woman if you be more you re none if you be one as you are well express d by all external warrant show it now by putt on the destined livery isabella i have no tongue but one gentle my lord let me entreat you speak the former language angelo plainly conceive i love you isabella my brother did love juliet and you tell me that he shall die for it angelo he shall not isabel if you give me love isabella i know your virtue hath a licence in t which seem a little foul than it is to pluck on other angelo believe me on mine honour my words express my purpose isabella ha little honour to be much believe and most pernicious purpose seeming seeming i will proclaim thee angelo look for t sign me a present pardon for my brother or with an outstretch d throat i ll tell the world aloud what man thou art angelo who will believe thee isabel my unsoil d name the austere of my life my vouch against you and my place i the state will so your accusation overweigh that you shall stifle in your own report and smell of calumny i have begun and now i give my sensual race the rein fit thy consent to my sharp appetite lay by all nicety and prolixious blush that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother by yielding up thy body to my will or else he must not only die the death but thy unkind shall his death draw out to lingering sufferance answer me to morrow or by the affection that now guide me most i ll prove a tyrant to him as for you say what you can my false o erweigh your true exit isabella to whom should i complain did i tell this who would believe me o perilous mouth that bear in them one and the self same tongue either of condemnation or approof bidding the law make court sy to their will hook both right and wrong to the appetite to follow as it draw i ll to my brother though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood yet hath he in him such a mind of honour that had he twenty head to tender down on twenty bloody block he ld yield them up before his sister should her body stoop to such abhorr

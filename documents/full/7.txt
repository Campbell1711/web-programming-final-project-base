years of country credit every thing to fall in love with what she fear d to look on it is a judgment maim d and most imperfect that will confess perfection so could err against all rule of nature and must be driven to find out practise of cunning hell why this should be i therefore vouch again that with some mixture powerful o er the blood or with some dram conjure to this effect he wrought upon her duke of venice to vouch this is no proof without more wide and more overt test than these thin habit and poor likelihood of modern seeming do prefer against him first senator but othello speak did you by indirect and forced course subdue and poison this young maid s affection or came it by request and such fair question as soul to soul affordeth othello i do beseech you send for the lady to the

vast and deserts idle rough quarry rocks and hill whose head touch heaven it was my hint to speak such was the process and of the cannibal that each other eat the anthropophagi and men whose head do grow beneath their shoulder this to hear would desdemona seriously incline but still the house affair would draw her thence which ever as she could with haste dispatch she ld come again and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse which i observing took once a pliant hour and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate whereof by parcel she had something heard but not intent i did consent and often did beguile her of her tear when i did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth suffer d my story being done she gave me for my pains a world of sigh she swore in faith twa strange twa passing strange  twa pitiful twa wondrous pitiful she wish d she had not heard it yet she wish d that heaven had made her such a man she thank d me and bade me if i had a friend that love her i should but teach him how to tell my story and that would woo her upon this hint i spake she love me for the danger i had pass d and i love her that she did pity them this only is the witchcraft i have use here come the lady let her witness it enter desdemona iago and attendant duke of venice i think this tale would win my daughter too good brabantio take

senator officer c othello my life upon her faith honest iago my desdemona must i leave to thee i prithee let thy wife attend on her and bring them after in the best advantage come desdemona i have but an hour of love of worldly matter and direction to spend with thee we must obey the time exeunt othello and desdemona roderigo iago iago what say st thou noble heart roderigo what will i do thinkest thou iago why go to bed and sleep roderigo i will incontinent drown myself iago if thou dost i shall never love thee after why thou silly gentleman roderigo it is silly to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician iago o villainous i have look upon the world for four times seven years and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen i would change my humanity with a baboon roderigo what should i do i confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it iago virtue a fig tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus our body are our garden to the which our will are garden so that if we will plant nettle or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herb or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idle or manure with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lie in our will if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and base of our nature would conduct us to most preposterous conclusion but we have reason to cool our rage motions our carnal sting our unbitt lust whereof i take this that you call love to be a sect or scion roderigo it cannot be iago it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will come be a man drown thyself drown cat and blind puppy i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cable of perdurable tough i could never better stead thee than now put money in thy purse follow thou the war defeat thy favour with an usurp beard i say put money in thy purse it cannot be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor put money in thy purse nor he his to her it was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration put but money in thy purse these moor are changeable in their will fill thy purse with money the food that to him now is as luscious as locust shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida she must change for youth when she is sate with his body she will find the error of her choice she must have change she must therefore put money in thy purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drown make all the money thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an err barbarian and a supersubtle venetian not too hard for my wit and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of drown thyself it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hang in compass thy joy than to be drown and go without her roderigo wilt thou be fast to my hope if i depend on the issue iago thou art sure of me go make money i have told thee often and i re tell thee again and again i hate the moor my cause is heart thine hath no less reason let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport there are many event in the womb of time which will be deliver traverse go provide thy money we will have more of this to morrow adieu roderigo where shall we meet i the morning iago at my lodging roderigo i ll be with thee betimes iago go to farewell do you hear roderigo roderigo what say you iago no more of drown do you hear roderigo i am change i ll go sell all my land exit iago thus do i ever make my fool my purse for i mine own gain d knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit i hate the moor and it is thought abroad that twixt my sheet he has done my office i know not if t be true but i for mere suspicion in that kind will do as if for surety he hold me well the better shall my purpose work on him cassio s a proper man let me see now to get his place and to plume up my will in double knavery how how let s see after some time to abuse othello s ear that he is too familiar with his wife he hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspect frame to make women false the moor is of a free and open nature that think men honest that but seem to be so and will as tender be led by the nose as ass are i have t it is engender d hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the world s light exit

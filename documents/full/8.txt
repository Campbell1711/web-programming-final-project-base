let thy soul be instruct mark me with what violence she first love the moor but for brag and telling her fantastic lie and will she love him still for prate let not thy discreet heart think it her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil when the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite lovely in favour sympathy in years manners and beauty all which the moor is defective in now for want of these require convenience her delicate tender will find itself abuse begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice now sir this grant as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stand so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio do a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putt on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose affection why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a finder of occasion that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantage though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisite in him that folly and green mind look after a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already roderigo i cannot believe that in her she s full of most blessed condition iago blessed fig s end the wine she drink is made of grape if she had been blessed she would never have love the moor blessed pudding didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst not mark that roderigo yes that i did but that was but courtesy iago lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thought they met so near with their lip that their breath embrace together villanous thought roderigo when these mutuality so marshal the way hard at hand come the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion pish but sir be you rule by me i have brought you from venice watch you to night for the command i ll lay t upon you cassio know you not i ll not be far from you do you find some occasion to anger cassio either by speak too loud or taint his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favourable minister roderigo well iago sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displant of cassio so shall you have a short journey to your desire by the means i shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitable remove without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity roderigo i will do this if i can bring it to any opportunity iago i warrant thee meet me by and by at the citadel i must fetch his necessaries ashore farewell roderigo adieu exit iago that cassio love her i do well believe it that she love him tis apt and of great credit the moor howbeit that i endure him not is of a constant loving noble nature and i dare think he ll prove to desdemona a most dear husband now i do love her too not out of absolute lust though peradventure i stand accountant for as great a sin but partly led to diet my revenge for that i do suspect the lusty moor hath leap d into my seat the thought whereof doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am even d with him wife for wife or failing so yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment cannot cure which thing to do if this poor trash of venice whom i trash for his quick hunting stand the putt on i ll have our michael cassio on the hip abuse him to the moor in the rank garb for i fear cassio with my night cap too make the moor thank me love me and reward me for making him egregious an ass and practise upon his peace and quiet even to madness tis here but yet confuse knavery s plain face is never seen tin use exit

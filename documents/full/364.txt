scene ii a public place flourish enter caesar antony for the course calpurnia portia deciu brutu cicero brutu cassius and casca a great crowd following among them a soothsayer caesar calpurnia casca peace ho caesar speak caesar calpurnia calpurnia here my lord caesar stand you directly in antoniu way when he doth run his course antoniu antony caesar my lord caesar forget not in your speed antoniu to touch calpurnia for our elder say the barren touched in this holy chase shake off their sterile curse antony i shall remember when caesar say do this it is perform d caesar set on and leave no ceremony out flourish soothsayer caesar caesar ha who call casca bid every noise be still peace yet again caesar who is it in the press that call on me i hear a tongue shrill than all the music cry caesar speak caesar is turn d to hear soothsayer beware the ides of march caesar what man is that brutu a soothsayer bid you beware the ides of march caesar set him before me let me see his face cassius fellow come from the throng look upon caesar caesar what say st thou to me now speak once again soothsayer beware the ides of march caesar he is a dreamer let us leave him pass sennet exeunt all except brutu and cassius cassius will you go see the order of the course brutu not i cassius i pray you do brutu i am not gamesome i do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony let me not hinder cassius your desire i ll leave you cassius brutu i do observe you now of late i have not from your eyes that gentle and show of love as i was wont to have you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand over your friend that love you brutu cassius be not deceive if i have veil d my look i turn the trouble of my countenance merely upon myself vex i am of late with passion of some difference conception only proper to myself which give some soil perhaps to my behavior but let not therefore my good friends be grieve among which number cassius be you one nor construe any further my neglect than that poor brutu with himself at war forget the show of love to other men cassius then brutu i have much mistook your passion by means whereof this breast of mine hath bury thought of great value worthy cogitation tell me good brutu can you see your face brutu no cassius for the eye see not itself but by reflection by some other things cassius  tis just and it is very much lament brutu that you have no such mirror as will turn your hidden worthy into your eye that you might see your shadow i have heard where many of the best respect in rome except immortal caesar speak of brutu and groan underneath this age s yoke have wish d that noble brutu had his eyes brutu into what danger would you lead me cassius that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me cassius therefore good brutu be prepared to hear and since you know you cannot see yourself so well as by reflection i your glass will modest discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of and be not jealous on me gentle brutu were i a common laugh or did use to stale with ordinary oath my love to every new protest if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and after scandal them or if you know that i profess myself in banquet to all the rout then hold me dangerous flourish and shout brutu what means this shouting i do fear the people choose caesar for their king cassius ay do you fear it then must i think you would not have it so brutu i would not cassius yet i love him well but wherefore do you hold me here so long what is it that you would impart to me if it be aught toward the general good set honour in one eye and death i the other and i will look on both indifferent for let the gods so speed me as i love the name of honour more than i fear death cassius i know that virtue to be in you brutu as well as i do know your outward favour well honour is the subject of my story i cannot tell what you and other men think of this life but for my single self i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself i was born free as caesar so were you we both have fed as well and we can both endure the winter s cold as well as he for once upon a raw and gusty day the trouble tiber chafe with her shore caesar said to me darest thou cassius now leap in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point upon the word accoutre as i was i plunge in and bade him follow so indeed he did the torrent roar d and we did buffet it with lusty sinew throw it aside and stem it with heart of controversy but ere we could arrive the point propose caesar cry help me cassius or i sink i as aenea our great ancestor did from the flame of troy upon his shoulder the old anchise bear so from the wave of tiber did i the tired caesar and this man is now become a god and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body if caesar careless but nod on him he had a fever when he was in spain and when the fit was on him i did mark how he did shake tis true this god did shake his coward lip did from their colour fly and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his lustre i did hear him groan ay and that tongue of his that bade the roman mark him and write his speech in their books alas it cry give me some drink titiniu as a sick girl ye gods it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone shout flourish brutu another general shout i do believe that these applause are for some new honours that are heap d on caesar cassius why man he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus and we petty men walk under his huge leg and peep about to find ourselves dishonourable grave men at some time are master of their fates the fault dear brutu is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underling brutu and caesar what should be in that caesar why should that name be sound more than yours write them together yours is as fair a name sound them it doth become the mouth as well weigh them it is as heavy conjure with em brutu will start a spirit as soon as caesar now in the name of all the gods at once upon what meat doth this our caesar feed that he is grown so great age thou art shame rome thou hast lost the breed of noble blood when went there by an age since the great flood but it was famed with more than with one man when could they say till now that talk d of rome that her wide wall encompass d but one man now is it rome indeed and room enough when there is in it but one only man o you and i have heard our father say there was a brutu once that would have brook d the eternal devil to keep his state in rome as easily as a king brutu that you do love me i am nothing jealous what you would work me to i have some aim how i have thought of this and of these times i shall recount hereafter for this present i would not so with love i might entreat you be any further move what you have said i will consider what you have to say i will with patience hear and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things till then my noble friend chew upon this brutu had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us cassius i am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from brutu brutu the games are done and caesar is return cassius as they pass by pluck casca by the sleeve and he will after his sour fashion tell you what hath proceed worthy note to day re enter caesar and his train brutu i will do so but look you cassius the angry spot doth glow on caesar s brow and all the rest look like a chidden train calpurnia s cheek is pale and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol being cross d in conference by some senator cassius casca will tell us what the matter is caesar antoniu antony caesar caesar let me have men about me that are fat sleek head men and such as sleep o nights yond cassius has a lean and hungry look he think too much such men are dangerous antony fear him not caesar he s not dangerous he is a noble roman and well given caesar would he were fat but i fear him not yet if my name were liable to fear i do not know the man i should avoid so soon as that spare cassius he read much he is a great observer and he looks quite through the deed of men he love no play as thou dost antony he hear no music seldom he smile and smile in such a sort as if he mock d himself and scorn d his spirit that could be move to smile at any thing such men as he be never at heart s ease while they behold a greater than themselves and therefore are they very dangerous i rather tell thee what is to be fear d than what i fear for always i am caesar come on my right hand for this ear is deaf and tell me truly what thou think st of him sennet exeunt caesar and all his train but casca casca you pull d me by the cloak would you speak with me brutu ay casca tell us what hath chance to day that caesar looks so sad casca why you were with him were you not brutu i should not then ask casca what had chance casca why there was a crown offer him and being offer him he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the people fell a shouting brutu what was the second noise for casca why for that too cassius they shout thrice what was the last cry for casca why for that too brutu was the crown offer him thrice casca ay marry was t and he put it by thrice every time gentle than other and at every putt by mine honest neighbour shout cassius who offer him the crown casca why antony brutu tell us the manner of it gentle casca casca i can as well be hang as tell the manner of it it was mere foolery i did not mark it i saw mark antony offer him a crown yet twa not a crown neither twa one of these coronet and as i told you he put it by once but for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it then he offer it to him again then he put it by again but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his finger off it and then he offer it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refuse it the rabble hoot and clap their chap hand and threw up their sweaty night cap and utter such a deal of stinking breath because caesar refuse the crown that it had almost choke caesar for he swounde and fell down at it and for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of opening my lip and receiving the bad air cassius but soft i pray you what did caesar swound casca he fell down in the market place and foam at mouth and was speechless brutu  tis very like he hath the failing sickness cassius no caesar hath it not but you and i and honest casca we have the fall sickness casca i know not what you mean by that but i am sure caesar fell down if the tag rag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displease them as they use to do the player in the theatre i am no true man brutu what said he when he came unto himself casca marry before he fell down when he perceive the common herd was glad he refuse the crown he pluck me ope his doublet and offer them his throat to cut an i had been a man of any occupation if i would not have taken him at a word i would i might go to hell among the rogue and so he fell when he came to himself again he said if he had done or said any thing amiss he desire their worship to think it was his infirmity three or four wench where i stood cry alas good soul and forgave him with all their heart but there s no heed to be taken of them if caesar had stab their mother they would have done no less brutu and after that he came thus sad away casca ay cassius did cicero say any thing casca ay he spoke greece cassius to what effect casca nay an i tell you that ill ne er look you i the face again but those that understood him smile at one another and shook their head but for mine own part it was greece to me i could tell you more news too marullu and flaviu for pull scarf off caesar s image are put to silence fare you well there was more foolery yet if i could remember it cassius will you sup with me to night casca casca no i am promise forth cassius will you dine with me to morrow casca ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eat cassius good i will expect you casca do so farewell both exit brutu what a blunt fellow is this grown to be he was quick mettle when he went to school cassius so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise however he put on this tardy form this rude is a sauce to his good wit which give men stomach to digest his words with better appetite brutu and so it is for this time i will leave you to morrow if you please to speak with me i will come home to you or if you will come home to me and i will wait for you cassius i will do so till then think of the world exit brutu well brutu thou art noble yet i see thy honourable metal may be wrought from that it is disposed therefore it is meet that noble mind keep ever with their likes for who so firm that cannot be seduce caesar doth bear me hard but he love brutu if i were brutu now and he were cassius he should not humour me i will this night in several hand in at his window throw as if they came from several citizen writings all tend to the great opinion that rome hold of his name wherein obscure caesar s ambition shall be glance at and after this let caesar seat him sure for we will shake him or worse days endure exit

world when the true and aunchient prerogatife and law of the war is not kept if you would take the pains but to examine the war of pompey the great you shall find i warrant you that there is no tiddle toddle nor pibble pabble in pompey s camp i warrant you you shall find the ceremony of the war and the care of it and the form of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise gower why the enemy is loud you hear him all night fluellen if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prate coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also look you be an ass and a fool and a prate coxcomb in your own conscience now gower i will speak lower fluellen i pray you and beseech you that you will exeunt gower and fluellen king henry v though it appear a little out of fashion there is much care and valour in this welshman enter three soldier john bat alexander court and michael williams court brother john bat is not that the morning which break yonder bat i think it be but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day williams we see yonder the beginning of the day but i think we shall never see the end of it who go there king henry v a friend williams under what captain serve you king henry v under sir thomas erpingham williams a good old commander and a most kind gentleman i pray you what think he of our estate king henry v even as men wreck upon a sand that look to be wash off the next tide bat he hath not told his thought to the king king henry v no nor it is not meet he should for though i speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i am the violet smell to him as it doth to me the element show to him as it doth to me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremony laid by in his naked he appear but a man and though his affection are higher mount than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing therefore when he see reason of fear as we do his fear out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army bat he may show what outward courage he will but i believe as cold a night as tis he could wish himself in thames up to the neck and so i would he were and i by him at all adventure so we were quit here king henry v by my troth i will speak my conscience of the king i think he would not wish himself any where but where he is bat then i would he were here alone so should he be sure to be ransom and a many poor men s lives save king henry v i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men s mind methinks i could not die any where so contented as in the king s company his cause being just and his quarrel honourable williams that s more than we know bat ay or more than we should seek after for we know enough if we know we are the kings subject if his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipe the crime of it out of us williams but if the cause be not good the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those leg and arms and head chop off in battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all we die at such a place some swear some crying for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some upon the debt they owe some upon their children raw left i am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle for how can they charitable dispose of any thing when blood is their argument now if these men do not die well it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it whom to disobey were against all proportion of subjection king henry v so if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinful miscarry upon the sea the imputation of his wicked by your rule should be impose upon his father that sent him or if a servant under his master s command transport a sum of money be assail by robber and die in many irreconcile iniquity you may call the business of the master the author of the servant s damnation but this is not so the king is not bound to answer the particular ending of his soldier the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their service besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrement of sword can try it out with all unspotted soldier some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguile virgin with the broken seal of perjury some making the war their bulwark that have before gore the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery now if these men have defeat the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from god war is his beadle war is vengeance so that here men are punish for before breach of the king s law in now the king s quarrel where they fear the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish then if they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impiety for the which they are now visit every subject s duty is the king s but every subject s soul is his own therefore should every soldier in the war do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and die so death is to him advantage or not die the time was blessed lost wherein such preparation was gain and in him that escape it were not sin to think that making god so free an offer he let him outlive that day to see his great and to teach other how they should prepare williams  tis certain every man that die ill the ill upon his own head the king is not to answer it bat but i do not desire he should answer for me and yet i determine to fight lusty for him king henry v i myself heard the king say he would not be ransom williams ay he said so to make us fight cheerful but when our throat are cut he may be ransom and we ne er the wise king henry v if i live to see it i will never trust his word after williams you pay him then that s a perilous shot out of an elder gun that a poor and private displeasure can do against a monarch you may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fan in his face with a peacock s feather you ll never trust his word after come tis a foolish saying king henry v your reproof is something too round i should be angry with you if the time were convenient williams let it be a quarrel between us if you live king henry v i embrace it williams how shall i know thee again king henry v give me any gage of thine and i will wear it in my bonnet then if ever thou darest acknowledge it i will make it my quarrel williams here s my glove give me another of thine king henry v there williams this will i also wear in my cap if ever thou come to me and say after to morrow this is my glove by this hand i will take thee a box on the ear king henry v if ever i live to see it i will challenge it williams thou darest as well be hang king henry v well i will do it though i take thee in the king s company williams keep thy word fare thee well bat be friends you english fool be friends we have france quarrel enow if you could tell how to reckon king henry v indeed the france may lay twenty france crown to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulder but it is no english treason to cut france crown and to morrow the king himself will be a clipper exeunt soldier upon the king let us our lives our soul our debt our careful wives our children and our sin lay on the king we must bear all o hard condition twin born with great subject to the breath of every fool whose sense no more can feel but his own wring what infinite heart s ease must kings neglect that private men enjoy and what have kings that private have not too save ceremony save general ceremony and what art thou thou idle ceremony what kind of god art thou that suffer st more of mortal grief than do thy worship what are thy rent what are thy coming in o ceremony show me

oft instead of homage sweet but poison d flattery o be sick great great and bid thy ceremony give thee cure think st thou the fiery fever will go out with title blown from adulation will it give place to flexure and low bend canst thou when thou command st the beggar s knee command the health of it no thou proud dream that play st so subtle with a king s repose i am a king that find thee and i know  tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball the sword the mace the crown imperial the intertissue robe of gold and pearl the farce title running fore the king the throne he sit on nor the tide of pomp that beat upon the high shore of this world no not all these thrice gorgeous ceremony not all these laid in bed majestic can sleep so sound as the wretched slave who with a body fill d and vacant mind get him to rest cramm d with distressful bread never see horrid night the child of hell but like a lackey from the rise to set sweat in the eye of phoebu and all night sleep in elysium next day after dawn doth rise and help hyperion to his horse and follow so the ever running year with profitable labour to his grave and but for ceremony such a wretch winding up days with toil and nights with sleep had the fore hand and vantage of a king the slave a member of the country s peace enjoy it but in gross brain little wot what watch the king keeps to maintain the peace whose hour the peasant best

touch their ear you shall perceive them make a mutual stand their savage eyes turn d to a modest gaze by the sweet power of music therefore the poet did feign that orpheu drew tree stone and flood since nought so stockish hard and full of rage but music for the time doth change his nature the man that hath no music in himself nor is not move with concord of sweet sound is fit for treason stratagem and spoils the motions of his spirit are dull as night and his affection dark as erebu let no such man be trust mark the music enter portia and nerissa portia that light we see is burning in

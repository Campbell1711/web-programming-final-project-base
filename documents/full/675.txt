scene iii the grecian camp before agamemnon s tent sennet enter agamemnon nestor ulysse menelau and other agamemnon prince what grief hath set the jaundice on your cheek the ample proposition that hope make in all designs begun on earth below fail in the promise large cheque and disaster grow in the vein of action highest rear d as knot by the conflux of meeting sap infect the sound pine and divert his grain tort and errant from his course of growth nor prince is it matter new to us that we come short of our suppose so far that after seven years siege yet troy wall stand sith every action that hath gone before whereof we have record trial did draw bias and thwart not answer the aim and that unbody figure of the thought that gave t surmise shape why then you prince do you with cheek abash d behold our works and call them shame which are indeed nought else but the protract trial of great jove to find persist constancy in men the fine of which metal is not found in fortune s love for then the bold and coward the wise and fool the artist and unread the hard and soft seem all affine and kin but in the wind and tempest of her frown distinction with a broad and powerful fan puff at all winnow the light away and what hath mass or matter by itself lie rich in virtue and unmingled nestor with due observance of thy godlike seat great agamemnon nestor shall apply thy latest words in the reproof of chance lie the true proof of men the sea being smooth how many shallow bauble boat dare sail upon her patient breast making their way with those of noble bulk but let the ruffian borea once enrage the gentle theti and anon behold the strong ribb d bark through liquid mountain cut bound between the two moist elements like perseu horse where s then the saucy boat whose weak untimber d side but even now co rivall d great either to harbour flee or made a toast for neptune even so doth valour s show and valour s worth divide in storm of fortune for in her ray and bright the herd hath more annoyance by the breeze than by the tiger but when the splitting wind make flexible the knee of knot oak and flies flee under shade why then the thing of courage as rouse with rage with rage doth sympathize and with an accent tune in selfsame key retort to chide fortune ulysse agamemnon thou great commander nerve and bone of greece heart of our numbers soul and only spirit in whom the temper and the mind of all should be shut up hear what ulysse speak besides the applause and approbation to which to agamemnon most mighty for thy place and sway to nestor and thou most reverend for thy stretch d out life i give to both your speech which were such as agamemnon and the hand of greece should hold up high in brass and such again as venerable nestor hatch d in silver should with a bond of air strong as the axle tree on which heaven ride knit all the greekish ear to his experienced tongue yet let it please both thou great and wise to hear ulysse speak agamemnon speak prince of ithaca and be t of less expect that matter needless of importless burden divide thy lip than we are confident when rank thersite ope his mastic jaws we shall hear music wit and oracle ulysse troy yet upon his basis had been down and the great hector s sword had lack d a master but for these instance the specialty of rule hath been neglect and look how many grecian tent do stand hollow upon this plain so many hollow faction when that the general is not like the hive to whom the forage shall all repair what honey is expect degree being vizarde the unworthiest show as fairly in the mask the heaven themselves the planet and this centre observe degree priority and place insisture course proportion season form office and custom in all line of order and therefore is the glorious planet sol in noble eminence enthroned and sphere amidst the other whose medicine eye correct the ill aspect of planet evil and post like the commandment of a king sans cheque to good and bad but when the planet in evil mixture to disorder wander what plague and what portent what mutiny what rage of the sea shake of earth commotion in the wind fright change horrors divert and crack rend and deracinate the unity and married calm of states quite from their fixure o when degree is shake which is the ladder to all high designs then enterprise is sick how could community degree in school and brotherhood in city peaceful commerce from divide shore the primogenitive and due of birth prerogative of age crown sceptre laurels but by degree stand in authentic place take but degree away untune that string and hark what discord follow each thing meet in mere oppugnance the bound waters should lift their bosom higher than the shore and make a sop of all this solid globe strength should be lord of imbecility and the rude son should strike his father dead force should be right or rather right and wrong between whose endless jar justice reside should lose their name and so should justice too then every thing include itself in power power into will will into appetite and appetite an universal wolf so doubly second with will and power must make perforce an universal prey and last eat up himself great agamemnon this chaos when degree is suffocate follow the choke and this neglect of degree it is that by a pace go backward with a purpose it hath to climb the general s disdain d by him one step below he by the next that next by him beneath so every step example by the first pace that is sick of his superior grow to an envious fever of pale and bloodless emulation and tis this fever that keeps troy on foot not her own sinew to end a tale of length troy in our weakness stand not in her strength nestor most wise hath ulysse here discover d the fever whereof all our power is sick agamemnon the nature of the sickness found ulysse what is the remedy ulysse the great achilles whom opinion crown the sinew and the forehand of our host have his ear full of his airy fame grow dainty of his worth and in his tent lie mock our designs with him patroclu upon a lazy bed the livelong day break scurril jest and with ridiculous and awkward action which slander he imitation call he pageant us sometime great agamemnon thy topless deputation he put on and like a strut player whose conceit lie in his hamstring and doth think it rich to hear the wooden dialogue and sound  twixt his stretch d footing and the scaffoldage such to be pity and o er wrest seeming he acts thy great in and when he speak  tis like a chime a mending with terms unsquared which from the tongue of roaring typhon dropp d would seem hyperbole at this fusty stuff the large achilles on his press d bed loll from his deep chest laugh out a loud applause cries excellent tis agamemnon just now play me nestor hem and stroke thy beard as he being drest to some oration that s done as near as the extremest end of parallel as like as vulcan and his wife yet god achilles still cries excellent  tis nestor right now play him me patroclu arm to answer in a night alarm and then forsooth the faint defect of age must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit and with a palsy fumble on his gorget shake in and out the rivet and at this sport sir valour die cries o enough patroclu or give me rib of steel i shall split all in pleasure of my spleen and in this fashion all our abilities gift nature shape several and general of grace exact achievement plot orders prevention excitement to the field or speech for truce success or loss what is or is not serve as stuff for these two to make paradox nestor and in the imitation of these twain who as ulysse say opinion crown with an imperial voice many are infect ajax is grown self will d and bear his head in such a rein in full as proud a place as broad achilles keeps his tent like him make factious feast rails on our state of war bold as an oracle and set thersite a slave whose gall coin slander like a mint to match us in comparison with dirt to weaken and discredit our exposure how rank soever round in with danger ulysse they tax our policy and call it cowardice count wisdom as no member of the war forestall prescience and esteem no act but that of hand the still and mental parts that do contrive how many hand shall strike when fitness call them on and know by measure of their observant toil the enemy weight why this hath not a finger s dignity they call this bed work mappery closet war so that the ram that batter down the wall for the great swing and rude of his poise they place before his hand that made the engine or those that with the fine of their soul by reason guide his execution nestor let this be grant and achilles horse make many theti son a tucket agamemnon what trumpet look menelau menelau from troy enter aenea agamemnon what would you fore our tent aenea is this great agamemnon s tent i pray you agamemnon even this aenea may one that is a herald and a prince do a fair message to his kingly ear agamemnon with surety strong than achilles arm  fore all the greekish head which with one voice call agamemnon head and general aenea fair leave and large security how may a stranger to those most imperial looks know them from eyes of other mortal agamemnon how aenea ay i ask that i might waken reverence and bid the cheek be ready with a blush modest as morning when she cold eyes the youthful phoebu which is that god in office guide men which is the high and mighty agamemnon agamemnon this trojan scorn us or the men of troy are ceremonious courtier aenea courtier as free as debonair unarm d as bend angel that s their fame in peace but when they would seem soldier they have gall good arms strong joint true sword and jove s accord nothing so full of heart but peace aenea peace trojan lay thy finger on thy lip the worthy of praise distain his worth if that the praise himself bring the praise forth but what the repine enemy commend that breath fame blow that praise sole sure transcend agamemnon sir you of troy call you yourself aenea aenea ay greece that is my name agamemnon what s your affair i pray you aenea sir pardon tis for agamemnon s ear agamemnon he hear naught private that come from troy aenea nor i from troy come not to whisper him i bring a trumpet to awake his ear to set his sense on the attentive bent and then to speak agamemnon speak frankly as the wind it is not agamemnon s sleep hour that thou shalt know trojan he is awake he tell thee so himself aenea trumpet blow loud send thy brass voice through all these lazy tent and every greece of mettle let him know what troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud trumpet sound we have great agamemnon here in troy a prince call d hector priam is his father who in this dull and long continue truce is rusty grown he bade me take a trumpet and to this purpose speak kings prince lords if there be one among the fair st of greece that hold his honour higher than his ease that seek his praise more than he fear his peril that know his valour and know not his fear that love his mistress more than in confession with truant vow to her own lip he love and dare avow her beauty and her worth in other arms than hers to him this challenge hector in view of trojan and of greece shall make it good or do his best to do it he hath a lady wise fair true than ever greece did compass in his arms and will to morrow with his trumpet call midway between your tent and wall of troy to rouse a grecian that is true in love if any come hector shall honour him if none he ll say in troy when he retire the grecian dame are sunburnt and not worth the splinter of a lance even so much agamemnon this shall be told our lovers lord aenea if none of them have soul in such a kind we left them all at home but we are soldier and may that soldier a mere recreant prove that means not hath not or is not in love if then one is or hath or means to be that one meet hector if none else i am he nestor tell him of nestor one that was a man when hector s grandsire suck d he is old now but if there be not in our grecian host one noble man that hath one spark of fire to answer for his love tell him from me i ll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver and in my vantbrace put this wither d brawn and meeting him will tell him that my lady was fair than his grandam and as chaste as may be in the world his youth in flood i ll prove this truth with my three drops of blood aenea now heaven forbid such scarcity of youth ulysse amen agamemnon fair lord aenea let me touch your hand to our pavilion shall i lead you sir achilles shall have word of this intent so shall each lord of greece from tent to tent yourself shall feast with us before you go and find the welcome of a noble foe exeunt all but ulysse and nestor ulysse nestor nestor what say ulysse ulysse i have a young conception in my brain be you my time to bring it to some shape nestor what is t ulysse this tis blunt wedge rive hard knot the seed pride that hath to this maturity blown up in rank achilles must or now be cropp d or shed breed a nursery of like evil to overbulk us all nestor well and how ulysse this challenge that the gallant hector send however it is spread in general name relate in purpose only to achilles nestor the purpose is perspicuous even as substance whose gross little character sum up and in the publication make no strain but that achilles were his brain as barren as bank of libya though apollo know  tis dry enough will with great speed of judgment ay with celerity find hector s purpose point on him ulysse and wake him to the answer think you nestor yes tis most meet whom may you else oppose that can from hector bring his honour off if not achilles though t be a sportful combat yet in the trial much opinion dwell for here the trojan taste our dear st repute with their finest palate and trust to me ulysse our imputation shall be oddly poised in this wild action for the success although particular shall give a scantl of good or bad unto the general and in such index although small prick to their subsequent volumes there is seen the baby figure of the giant mass of things to come at large it is supposed he that meet hector issue from our choice and choice being mutual act of all our soul make merit her election and doth boil as twere from us all a man distill d out of our virtue who miscarry what heart receive from hence the conquer part to steel a strong opinion to themselves which entertain d limb are his instrument in no less working than are sword and bow directive by the limb ulysse give pardon to my speech therefore tis meet achilles meet not hector let us like merchant show our foulest wares and think perchance they ll sell if not the lustre of the better yet to show shall show the better do not consent that ever hector and achilles meet for both our honour and our shame in this are dogg d with two strange follower nestor i see them not with my old eyes what are they ulysse what glory our achilles shares from hector were he not proud we all should share with him but he already is too insolent and we were better parch in afric sun than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes should he scape hector fair if he were foil d why then we did our main opinion crush in taint of our best man no make a lottery and by device let blockish ajax draw the sort to fight with hector among ourselves give him allowance for the better man for that will physic the great myrmidon who broil in loud applause and make him fall his crest that proud than blue iris bends if the dull brainless ajax come safe off we ll dress him up in voice if he fail yet go we under our opinion still that we have better men but hit or miss our project s life this shape of sense assume ajax employ d pluck down achilles plume nestor ulysse now i begin to relish thy advice and i will give a taste of it forthwith to agamemnon go we to him straight two cur shall tame each other pride alone must tarre the mastiff on as twere their bone exeunt

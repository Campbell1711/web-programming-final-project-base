good this gloucester should be quick rid the world to rid us of the fear we have of him cardinal that he should die is worthy policy but yet we want a colour for his death  tis meet he be condemn d by course of law suffolk but in my mind that were no policy the king will labour still to save his life the commons haply rise to save his life and yet we have but trivial argument more than mistrust that show him worthy death york so that by this you would not have him die suffolk ah york no man alive so fain as i york  tis york that hath more reason for his death but my lord cardinal and you my lord of suffolk say as you think and speak it from your soul were t not all one an empty eagle were set to guard the chicken from a hungry kite as place duke humphrey for the king s protector queen margaret so the poor chicken should be sure of death suffolk madam tis true and were t not madness then to make the fox surveyor of the fold who being accused a crafty murder his guilt should be but idle post over because his purpose is not execute no let him die in that he is a fox by nature prove an enemy to the flock before his chaps be stain d with crimson blood as humphrey prove by reason to my liege and do not stand on quillet how to slay him be it by gin by snare by subtlety sleep or waking tis no matter how so he be dead for that is good deceit which mate him first that first intend

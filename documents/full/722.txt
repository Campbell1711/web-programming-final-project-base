mortal paw a fast tiger safe by the tooth than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold king philip i may disjoin my hand but not my faith cardinal pandulph so makest thou faith an enemy to faith and like a civil war set st oath to oath thy tongue against thy tongue o let thy vow first made to heaven first be to heaven perform d that is to be the champion of our church what since thou sworest is sworn against thyself and may not be perform by thyself for that which thou hast sworn to do amiss is not amiss when it is truly done and being not done where do tend to ill the truth is then most

burn d it is religion that doth make vow kept but thou hast sworn against religion by what thou swear st against the thing thou swear st and makest an oath the surety for thy truth against an oath the truth thou art unsure to swear swear only not to be forsworn else what a mockery should it be to swear but thou dost swear only to be forsworn and most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear therefore thy later vow against thy first is in thyself rebellion to thyself and better conquest never canst thou make than arm thy constant and thy noble parts against these giddy loose suggestion upon which better part our prayer come in if thou vouchsafe them but if not then know the peril of our curse light on thee so heavy as thou shalt not shake them off but in despair die under their black weight

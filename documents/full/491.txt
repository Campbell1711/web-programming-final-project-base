in the afternoon barnardine for my better satisfaction let me have claudio s head sent me by five let this be duly perform with a thought that more depend on it than we must yet deliver thus fail not to do your office as you will answer it at your peril what say you to this sir duke vincentio what is that barnardine who is to be execute in the afternoon provost a bohemian born but here nurse un and bred one that is a prisoner nine years old duke vincentio how came it that the absent duke had not either deliver him to his liberty or execute him i have heard it was ever his manner to do so provost his friends still wrought reprieve for him and indeed his fact till now in the government of lord angelo came not to an undoubtful proof duke vincentio it is now apparent provost most manifest and not deny by himself duke vincentio hath he born himself penitent in prison how seem he to be touched provost a man that apprehend death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of what s past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperate mortal duke vincentio he wants advice provost he will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many times a day if not many days entire drunk we have very oft awake him as if to carry him to execution and show him a seeming warrant for it it hath not move him at all duke vincentio more of him anon there is written in your brow provost honesty and constancy if i read it not truly my ancient skill beguile me but in the bold of my cunning i will lay myself in hazard claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath sentence him to make you understand this in a manifest effect i crave but four days respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy provost pray sir in what duke vincentio in the delay death provost a lack how may i do it have the hour limited and an express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view of angelo i may make my case as claudio s to cross this in the smallest duke vincentio by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my instruction may be your guide let this barnardine be this morning execute and his head born to angelo provost angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour duke vincentio o death s a great disguise and you may add to it shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bare before his death you know the course is common if any thing fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead against it with my life provost pardon me good father it is against my oath duke vincentio were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy provost to him and to his substitute duke vincentio you will think you have made no offence if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing provost but what likelihood is in that duke vincentio not a resemblance but a certainty yet since i see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease attempt you i will go further than i meant to pluck all fear out of you look you sir here is the hand and seal of the duke you know the character i doubt not and the signet is not strange to you provost i know them both duke vincentio the contents of this is the return of the duke you shall anon over read it at your pleasure where you shall find within these two days he will be here this is a thing that angelo know not for he this very day receive letters of strange tenor perchance of the duke s death perchance enter into some monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ look the unfold star call up the shepherd put not yourself into amaze how these things should be all difficulty are but easy when they are known call your executioner and off with barnardine s head i will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place yet you are amaze but this shall absolutely resolve you come away it is almost clear dawn exeunt
